politics,Terror powers expose tyranny,The Lord Chancellor defended government plans introduce control orders keep foreign British terrorist suspects house arrest isnt enough evidence put trial Lord Falconer insists proposals equate police state strike balance protecting public threat terrorism upholding civil liberties But thriller writer Frederick Forsyth tells BBC News personal response move There mortal danger aimed heart Britain Or says Home Secretary Charles Clarke My reaction So It I cynical care I care country much But 66 years I alive one hour one day one month one year threat aimed us My point British always coped without becoming dictatorship We coped fear without becoming state based fear coped threat without turning country land state threat But Blair government seeks create tyranny defend us alQaeda tyranny I born 25 August 1938 The mortal threat back scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler A week first birthday threat become reality We war My father wore uniform five years After 1945 yearned peace last But 1946 Winston Churchill told us Baltic Adriatic Iron Curtain descended across Europe Behind Iron Curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat Josef Stalin triggered Cold War Berlin blockade 1948 My whole generation blighted We threatened nuclear holocaust nuclear wind nuclear winter We built shelters would sheltered nothing We spent treasure weapons instead hospitals We took silly precautions Some fought marched futilely Some pretended The Cold War lasted 43 years remained parliamentary democracy By early seventies terrorism well Al Fatah Black September Red Brigades us IRA INLA Thirty years 300 policemen women 600 soldiers 3000 civilians dead even IRA bombs could force us become tyranny That tyrants lost Civil rights infringed little humanly possible Evidence taken secret protect covert sources yes one judge nojury courts instituted juries terrorised Informants given immunity crimes win bigger battle But habeas corpus die right appeal abolished Now threat Islamic fundamentalism Its leaders want destroy society IRA It based funded abroad IRA It sleeper fanatics inside society IRA It extremely hard penetrate agents IRA The prime movers easy bring trial neither IRA But And without becoming tyranny Now Blair government proposes law system fascism communism The citizen arrested held without charge trial even careful consideration experienced judge whim political activist called government minister To protected terror government says must become tyranny But tyranny based citizens terror This victory defeat shot fired An interesting article good see widening participation debate I suggest move one step Our bombs bullets shatter peace invading foreign nations imprisoning innocent hunting shadows cannot destroy evil mind hatred within heart Rather focusing upon effect consider cause terrorism begin bombs Why try foreign policy compassion enhance democracy share freedom I agree Frederick Forsyth We really cant deal terrorism turning Britain fascist state What really need honesty security services politicians If evidence bring people trial probably isnt Our security services behave like detective decided certain person guilty rakes kinds obscure flimsy evidence try prove real villain gets away Remember WMD Iraq Just person may made stupid naive decisions life make terrorist In overly politically correct society good see someone like Mr Forsyth speak Yes oppression British government past overstepping mark places like Ireland yes still democracy rare arrested without chargetrial etc apart number prisoners Belmarsh goal exampleThis country signs human rights pretends apply people nothing fear innocent people defined When ID cards become mandatory data collected protected Data Protection Act readily available people like GCHQ control person whose ID checked The threat new You cannot compare threats past years Forsyth says 3000 died 30 years terrorism 3000 people died one morning NY September 11th 2001 The threat today terrorists acquire nuclear biological technology A Kilo Semtex flatten building Kilo plutonium flatten city You combination people perform terrorist acts technology rapidly becoming accessible I agree government probably encouraging degree masshysteria talking threat talkingdown threat nothing unacceptable The problem issue isnt important fact general Brits politically apathetic times let go without telling government However nation gave world common law true sense rights individual liberty I hope prove one step far As somebody Chinese origin I say country used good place migrate start new life Whilst life wasnt perfect could make better Now riddled red tape told cannot We politicallycorrect allowed beliefs opinions We Prime Minister spends much time meddling US politics affairs little lives British Citizens home abroad Mr Forsyth done good job voicing opinions Lets hope BBC doesnt get gagged letting people express views The people right know BBCs role Inform Educate Entertain I agree Terrorists intend spread fear reality government spread fear constant publicising invisible enemy dangerous must allow ride roughshod rights liberties In end thing seek protect giving name safety invisible enemy The terrorists already I absolutely agree Frederick Forsyth Yes defend terrorism existing laws seem adequate The idea new terrorism demands new powers erroneous The evidence real terrorist capability UK scant Ricin example dangerous poison weapon mass destruction What really worrying enthusiasm Mr Blair government authoritarian reactions attempts manipulate electorate fear If government way ID cards tracking totalitarianism matters little whether give terrorists demands We lost precious freedom Bush Blair constantly tells us seek bring others I agree wholeheartedly Mr Forsyth I shocked ease government prepared wipe major portion liberties British people enjoyed centuries right deprived liberty without trial open court That goes right back Magna Carta ordinary people spilled blood enforce right governments thought knew best When look todays Britain realise George Orwell wrong one thing date Frederick Forsyth puts beautifully The government seeking introduce police state The new powers home internment without trial follow pattern includes introduction surveillance via compulsory ID cards linking data bases together unBritish idea swear allegiance state age 18 years We sleepwalking Wake An interesting view missing two crucial facts new threat 1 If terrorists acquire weapons mass destruction WILL use without fear Mutually Assured Destruction kept cold war state tense balance These people use devastating force us without fear ANY consequence 2 The terrorists prepared use suicide bombers means could kill innocent people London Underground could little stop Because terrorists potentially SO deadly come new tougher responses It little late day people outside London wake one morning find London nuked We wont much society left debate Hes correct says Mind seem forgotten disgraceful internment policy Northern Ireland probably caused many idealistic misguided young Catholics join IRA Administrative detention Muslims could similar effect Surely public would better protected security services rather alerting suspect terrorist placing house arrest longThey place suspect terrorist surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute even better prevent terrorist attack I dont usually much time Mr Forsyths largely right wing views time got spot There doubt terrorist organisations would like harm UK doubtful whether alQaeda global organisation coordinating The rise surveillance cameras ID cards plan charge road use tracking every vehicle times stuff nightmares Add new legislation effectively means protection law removed anyone whim Home Secretary I genuinely wonder sort world two children inherit Where end As stands terrorists need attack UK government soon people terrorised could achieve bombs Mr Forsyth expressed exactly gut fears reservations proposed legislation could verbalise Thank Mr Forsyth seems forget killings Troubles occurred sides religious divide carried killers sides He also forgets basic Human Rights suspended Experienced Judges sat greatest miscarriages justice times For little return maximum alienation These laws emphasis Islamic threat Forsyth wrong The nature current threat new It longer armed forces Soviet threat Eastern bloc It I The terrorist aim kill indiscriminately The best comparison therefore blitz 1941 At time let us forget suspects foreign British routinely rounded interned duration war without complaints public We must forget war Id say likelihood attack sleeper cell fundamentalist lunatics major UK target When If probability Ill bet money like day attack Freddie Forsyth saying government didnt enough protect UK People like Forsyth see one side argument side opposite New Labour Tony Blair I agree wholeheartedly Mr Forsyth The reason country wonderful place live attack terrorists government The perpetuation perceived terrorist threat alleged terrorists government I believe government least highly questionable worst sinister At point feel enough control every single person British Isles tagged monitored constantly Our freedom craftily surreptitiously whittled away government gaining nothing It great concern everyone I slightly older Mr Forsyth therefore lived history I police state would like think I lived one I think attack Iraq made international situation worse may provoked acts terrorism How true There extremely worrying parallels Britain Germany 30s I never thought would easy take country within Mr Forsyth forgotten one key point terrorists threaten Britain today well aware Hitler Stalin IRA failed As result modern day terrorists willing things predecessors That mean civil liberties modern Britain must eroded counter threat always absolute last resort But meet new threat defeat sinister fanaticism todays terrorists may need things little differently Let us hope Frederic Forsythes comments seem wellthoughtout analysis human society whole Britain particular resist temptation overprotect fear It fear enables terrorists succeed end terrorists come forms Mr Forsythes opening comments suggest I reminded quote attributed Thomas Jefferson A nation limits freedom name security neither The government faced incredibly difficult task made policy deal Its well criticising policy Mr Forsythe cant draw years experience offer alternative I say So opinions Frederick Forsyths rhetoric absurd conclusions laughable He distorts reality serve prejudice New Labour This government seeks balance protection democracy minimum loss civil rights It Frederick Forsyth extremist appreciate need balance I rarely find agreeing My Forsyth instance I think correct The rule law must prevail civil liberties worth defending If government hold suspects without charge trial whats next I agree absolutely By introducing fascist type laws loose moral high ground fight terror Our democratic system perfect Churchill points better others tried Terrorist attacks take place many reasons take personal risk return personal freedom I usually agree Mr Forsyth spot The single biggest threat face government dedicated acting illegally manipulating international national law suit purpose Totalitarianism always requires outside threat justifying range extraordinary powers leaders want The British government far greater threat terrorist organisation Although principle I agree Frederick Forsyth fails address one key point alQaeda attacks though obviously none yet UK seek kill maximum number people The IRA wanted limit death toll attacks maintain support among republican movement Yes I agree Mr Forsyths views I believe governments plans justified There reaction negative influence US Presidents interpretation democracy freedom He uses arguments current WWII Wars liberate Iraq Afghanistan Syria Iran come We leaving poor inheritance future generations Mr Forsyth wonderful writer keep fiction belongs The British Government going road Mr Forsyth suggests Sadly comments make lot people believe governed people fast becoming tyrants instead genuinely committed stopping tyranny even method employed moment alien British people lived democracy protected Tony Blair others like mind Mr Forsyth seems putting along side scruffy little Austrian Thomas Hobbes would smiling grave Labours propositions Like New Labour called libertarian Like New Labour believed promoting peoples best interests But Forsythe criticises government Hobbes criticised subsequent philosophers arguing way hands totalitarians Simply put argued favour ultimate liberty liberty live man prepared surrender liberties supreme sovereign protection fellow barbaric man Hobbes roundly condemned posterity rightly I hope New Labour suffers treatment I agree Mr Forsyths views The governments approach totally spirit British democracy They must allowed get away Of course Frederick wrong Britain winning war IRA hes wrong country becoming tyranny Has forgotten shoot kill torture internment without trial collusion loyalist death squads etc My background somewhat similar Freddies I persuaded agree many sentiments We moral justification imposing system government anyone systematically depriving citizens basic individual collective freedoms Whilst principle keeping potential terrorists house arrest might seem superficially attractive unfortunately also first step towards totalitarianism Who decide suspect Why believe Who faith honesty integrity competence intelligence services politicians light events recent years What stop false denunciations What falsely accused lose careers Who support families Will children still go school It smacks methods Nazi Germany Stalins Russia Ceausescus Romania list goes It looks new dark age coming I see opinion Mr Forsyths remarks divided The problem I see support imprisonment without trial believe never happen family people dont like scared But history shown laws like always get abused power After today may scared people power someday power may scared And day youll one imprisoned without chance justice Our laws cannot imprisoned whim police forces shown deserving If imprison people without trial indeterminate period better fighting I never thought possible agree single word uttered Frederick Forsyth Im wholehearted agreement one We nation grave danger duped pro US propaganda course also means well inherit total paranoia allow governments political persuasion incidentally gradually insidiously impose police state well tried tested back door methods I grieve future children wonder theyre adamant dont ever want This government much fanfare signs us European Convention Human Rights wants introduce indefinite house arrest without trial This puts par government Burma Like many respondents I wouldnt usually think Mr Forsyth someone whose views I share instance opposing Charles Clarks proposals house arrest I agree wholeheartedly Mr Forsyth I agree Mr Forsyth Just look facts government along US invaded another sovereign country Iraq selecting intelligence backed case based fear The facts turned different If individuals treated distorted way weve done damage terrorist organisation could bombs We become animals I agree many ways Mr Forsyth said respected influence within world must seen walking walk well talking talk accuse countries Zimbabwe Burma human rights abuses locking people may totally innocent hypocrisy highest order Mr Forsyth links Islamic fundamentalism new threat However appears misunderstood term Islamic fundamentalism It pointed Muslim adheres true fundamentals Quraan teachings last Prophet Muhammad Islamic Fundamentalist This person commit suicide shape form shehe kill innocent women men children This person selfreflective constantly tries better herhis actions good others The people Mr Forsyth labels new threat follow correct teachings Islam They arrived interpretations assumptions regards actions On top claim following Islam true form I accept intentions policies make Britain safer place I cannot think single example history sort thing ever made difference Northern Ireland internment certainly didnt achieve anything bombings didnt stop could argued achieved supply IRA yet angry resentful republicans willing take arms British Being eight years older Frederick Forsyth survivor Blitz London easy agree absolutely spot During IRA bombings massive explosions Canary Wharf right I write also left City London Notwithstanding attempted nearly successful assassination attempts Prime Minister Thatcher Brighton later occupants 10 Downing Street retaliatory blitz Belfast Dublin Afghanistan Iraq Even England true peril 1940 apart detentions wholesale derogation habeas corpus like We see latest attempts liberties including ID cards Winston Churchill decided go since said average Bobby beat could relied tempted take undue advantage citizen going lawful activities incidentally I still remember old ID card number Hence clear far great police state powers set statute books resisted neutered What I add Mr Forsyths eloquently put arguments except applause Well done man standing counted war

entertainment,Brits debate urban music,Joss Stone 17yearold soul singer Devon beat Dizzee Rascal Jamelia Lemar The Streets win best British urban act Brit Awards Her victory reignited debate urban music Im really comfortable word urban Its word thats manufactured country America describe black music The word urban seems cover broad range black music wrong How far Brits removed innercity music people Its far removed I dont expect get bang The music industry isnt championing music particular genre well anyway People dont feel like thats anything us I dont feel like urban musics celebrated Joss Stone winning nominated Brits acknowledging theres urban music scene kick teeth end day Its really relevant If Joss Stone closest thing feel comfortable championing looks like sounds shes signed Its got nothing whats really going Urban genre broad If look underneath urban number core elements include hiphop RB garage obviously comes soul Joss Stone soul artist Her first album called The Soul Sessions So urban broad brushstroke umbrella top subgenres offshoots Joss Stone amazing success US given shes UK artist What really captured everybodys imagination 17yearold Devon voice die bunch really really good tunes looks good I think thats whats done The award best British urban act voted viewers MTV Base I dont think Joss worthy winner She makes soul music definitely comes category describe urban The fact shes Devon interesting thing music cover made large cities shes literally rural The great thing urban music theres big range If sort root black music dance music Britain I think thats call urban thats new subcategory ubercategory come Joss Stone certainly old enough experiences older soul singer couldnt argue inauthentic emotions coming somewhere genuine It come across real Thats cutoff point thats way judge people What urban means us organisation politically correct term describe music originated black background Music become inclusive fighting multicultural Britain fighting inclusion rather exclusion If Joss Stone accepted within urban music community I think acts ethnicities classical music rock accepted Race doesnt make difference everyone included Out awards dished yesterday Im still trying find people races received sort recognition award A type music especially street music originates city typically reflects characteristic urban life She might urban RB become hip hop tainted thing RB stands Rhythm And Blues remember That Joss Stone rubbish certain If anyone deserves win award urban music I think probably include HipHop Soul Funk least rock pop year Streets although Dizzee Rascal stakes good claim She definitely deserved win prize Joss Stones albums quite simply amazing easily better anything else released last year This whole debate urban isnt urban completely pointless probably fueled urban artists werent nominated didnt win I cant see people cant congratulate talent She deserve I agree comments urban music Its stupid phrase particularly British In states tend use hip hop RB I say hip hop lot people idea Im talking Very strange Whats name A rose name etc If people want call urban If really analysed term dance music misleading doesnt describe everything dance Whilst I agree term urban open interpretation strikes simply weird Joss Stone Urban I hear played parties inner cities I live Brixton never heard The Soul Sessions pumping bass heavy sound system parties Ive Good luck Joss Stone lets celebrate victory lets also question artists successful talented Jamelia Lemar Kanye West Dizzee Rascal Alicia Keys Outkast didnt see single black artist stage collecting award So youre saying music black heritage allowed sung anyone isnt black And shouldnt acknowledged even theyre pretty dam good Shes 17 amazing voice Good Oh shes black well lets make feel real bad How dare Though hang didnt socalled public vote one This idea pigeonholing whatever popular time different happening 1940s 50s relation Jazz The media called anything swinging beat syncopated melody soulful feeling Jazz much chagrin artists It would mean blues would put mould bebop cool ragtime different styles time Jazz remains massively misunderstood term And Urban music In truth lazy term categorise music dont really understand Soul garage worlds apart musically Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam doubt connections If let music speak judge success artist number awards maybe enjoy music rather represents I demand prize rural music Sucks cities way better We hay one thing Excluding become known urban music would bad excluding Lenny Kravitz Hendrix rock music black surely I dont understand point Ty making If Lemar makes music less soulful Joss work might said nothing btw im black How urban spent life Devon countryside Nonsense I love Joss bits dont care branding amazing music full stop Stop puting brackets lets call music lets especially drop black urban tag nearly music came black origin sets example ok pigeonhole people music colour Surely point urban music category simply acknowledge artists making historically considered urban music irrelevent colour skin originate Joss Stone simply singing certain type music considered urban style someone inner city indeed USA could sing country music If person good authentic sound would criticise referred country music artist representing style The term urban reference music genre UK developed part controversy surrounding branding MOBO Awards The term Music Black Origin confused offended many people This particularly strange given existence Asian Music Awards It appears use black white relation music makes people feel uncomfortable The term urban therefore invoked sidestep debate type music came first black white thereby rendering issue colourblind The result redundant new debate urban also means Perhaps created new term altogether describe various strains soulRnB HipHop one also mean something else done Crunk Urban word thats come recently describe black music thats become popular The word wasnt even use common use five six years ago Its way industry clumping together without call black music people oversensitive might call racist Im band called urban I despise label Id hate think I belonged neat marketing niche thats Ever since music channels record comapnies tried fracture consider music black origin labels used undermine status good music commodity Look TV broadcasters unable reach young people without condesending simply play urban music soundtrack dreadful cheap lift music Ignore labels music As black man I think I agree statements least statements made key executives Black people lead music invented We stop calling genre meaningless northing meaningless The real question would Joss Stone would successful music black Same thing Streets Amy Winehouse etc Whos ever heard Terri Walker Rhian Benson They 10 times better Joss Stone Urban Music Awards think Mobos Brits So Joss Stone Urban awards Her music great soul surely Urban banner What The Streets Would people whining Mike Skinner white It seems lot fuss race real issue music nothing else Urban PC version saying black music Im doubting Ms Stones talent didnt Jamelia Lemar get Brit This reminds happened Craig David Soul II Soul past getting nominations easy get picking Brit seems hardest thing Refreshing see people making reasonable intelligent comments topic days More power people You said music like music dont like cares label put That entire category mess How people like Dizzee Rascal Joss Stone Its like putting Eminem Bob Geldof She nominated Best British R B act Joss Stone deserved win award talents I dont think urban sing angels Robbie Williams Urban nonsense term music black origin Well doesnt include rock Music made inner cities Well almost bands end making music LondonManchester etc And doesnt make weird implication black people live cities It doesnt make sense Why music put genre Its music like dont Simple I play heavy metal band We urban music far Im concerned We live cities spend working life urban environment It therefore directly shapes write musically Urban seems new name styles black music Why needed rebrand I dont know name misleading Oasis originate city characterise urban life know therefore fit term urban yet theyre white rock band wont described Joss Stone fantastic voice great timing delivery reason need award Brit All urban categorisation redtape music business best ignored Yeah deserved She talented Urban crap meaningless politically correct probably actually racist marketing term though Theres two kinds music good bad
