politics,Campaign cold calls questioned,Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about peoples voting intentions The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls The information commissioners office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the runup to the general election But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service TPS lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising But that did not happen for voter identification calls When we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers She said We do apply TPS but in line with the law We would not do things that are not allowed in the law Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them But classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said Mr Jones If a party rings a person who is registered on TPS to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations In summary whether a party calling TPS registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed Mr Jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue Earlier Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor wrote to the watchdog saying The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them

entertainment,My memories of Marley,To mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star Bob Marley Rob Partridge Marleys former head of press at Island Records remembers the man behind the legend Partridge worked with Marley from 1977 until the Jamaican musicians death in 1981 I joined Island Records in 1977 and the first week I was there I worked on his show at the Rainbow Theatre It was one of the last dates he did in London The album Exodus came out in 1977 and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status By 1979 he was the biggest touring attraction in the world I remember going to see dates in Milan and Turin and they were enormous concerts Bob was one of the most mesmeric people Ive ever had the privilege to work with He must have had an iron will to succeed Bob was a very driven individual You realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in He didnt suffer fools gladly At the risk of stating the obvious he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest Ive ever seen I saw him many times I recall in 1978 he came to the UK for Top of the Pops and a Daily Mirror journalist did a halfhour interview It was interrupted to do a rehearsal He came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a World Cup match on TV He sat down in front of the TV and after 10 minutes it was obvious he wasnt going to move That was the end of it The Mirror had a very truncated interview The last time I saw him was in London in 1980 I arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in Fulham Bob was a good player We are talking about Jamaicanstyle football He was an attacking midfield player His team assembled wherever his gigs were We played in Brazil against some World Cupwinning players It was always a struggle for him to connect with Black America Reggae did not correspond with disco in the 70s But Bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in America and the Third World In 1991 ten years after his death he sold more records than at any time during his life We saw Black America taking Bob into their hearts for the first time Bob in worldwide terms is the greatest music star there has ever been If you went to Africa he would be recognised everywhere in places John Lennon or Elvis wouldnt be No disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest the best and the most influential artist in popular music Well 1981 was to be the year he toured Africa with Stevie Wonder He had only performed in Zimbabwe and Guinea before Of course the 1981 tour never happened but the whole of Africa would have embraced him We cant speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just 36 years old I had no sense his career was going to go downhill Bob was endlessly optimistic about the way Africa would turn out He realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind Im sure if he were alive today he would believe Africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the Aids epidemic The final tune of his final album was Redemption Song one of the most incredible classics of all time

tech,Apple laptop is greatest gadget,The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by US magazine Mobile PC The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs The magazine has compiled an alltime top 100 list of gadgets which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two Gadgets needed moving parts andor electronics to warrant inclusion The magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a selfcontained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device In general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine In the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded The oldest gadget in the top 100 is the abacus which the magazine dates at 190 AD and put in 60th place Other preelectronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 59th position the marine chronometer from 1761 42nd position and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 28th position The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10 which also includes the first flash mp3 player Diamond Multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera Casio QV10 and mobile phone Motorola Startac The most popular gadget of the moment the Apple iPod is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13 Sonys third entry in the top 20 is the CDP101 CD player from 1983 Who can forget the crystalline hissfree blast of Madonnas Like A Virgin emanating from their first CD player asked the magazine Karl Elseners knife the Swiss Army Knife from 1891 is at number 20 in the list Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone 23rd the Nintendo GameBoy 25th and the Pulsar quartz digital watch 36th The list also contains plenty of oddities the Pez sweet dispenser 98th 1990s toy Tamagotchi 86th and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler 84th Almost everyone has a mobile phone how many people own a Powerbook or an iPod The findings of this magazine are not very convincing What about the magnetic compass We still use it 1000 years after it was invented I am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre For example the Sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas Minidisc Flash MP3 portable CD players etc are really just improvements in technology My favourite true gadgets are probably my portable MiniDisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing I use to froth up my coffee Calm down its only in their opinion and any list that includes the Taser in the top 100 gadgets has to be suspect Swiss army knife and no question about it How many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as usefulpopular You dont need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out This list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the American authors and the overwhelmingly British responses Brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties Sinclair whilst the Americans focus on Apple TV remotes and TiVO which probably is rather obscure in Europe What about the Soda Stream This gadget changed my preteen life Lap tops may enable you to think different but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy How about Astro Wars one of the pioneers for computer games i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today However tried it the other day and it was rubbish still a great gadget of its time Why worry about mobile phones Soon they will be subsumed into the PDAs laptops etc What about the Marine Chronometer Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries For its time a technological marvel Sony Net Minidisc It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market I always used my NetMD and could not go anywhere without it A laptop computer is not a gadget Its a working tool The Sinclair Executive was the worlds first pocket calculator I think this should be there as well How about the clockwork radio Or GPS Or a pocket calculator All these things are useful to real people not just PC magazine editors Are the people who created this list insane Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone It has revolutionised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop From outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker An interesting list Of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc the Tandy 100 The size of A4 paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible Whats an Apple Powerbook 100 Its out of date not much of a gadget Surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener Swiss Army Knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves It has to be the mobile phone No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980 A true gadget it could be carried around and shown off All top 10 are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current hightech obsession than anything else I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20 Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time The first home machine with a true multitakings OS Shame the marketing was so bad Apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else Utter rubbish Yes the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed No competition Id also put Apples Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason I only wish that Vulcan Incs Flipstart wasnt just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise What about radios and TVs The swiss army knife By far the most useful gadget I got mine 12 years ago Still wearing and using it a lot It stood the test of time Psion Organiser series 3 should be up there Had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable Case design was good batteries in the hinge a first I think Great product innovation The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers oferr mobile PC Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site Its obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that The Motorola Startac should be Number One Why There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices The Psion series 3c The first most practical way to carry all your info around I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now Id have put the mobile phone high up the list Probably a Nokia model Sinclair Spectrum 16k It plugged into the tv Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and thats what I do for a living now I wish more modern notebooks even Apples newest offerings were more like the PB100 Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses Theyre invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use Congratulations to Apple a deserved win

tech,Wifi web reaches farmers in Peru,A network of community computer centres linked by wireless technology is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in Peru The pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima aims to offer the 6000strong community uptodate information on agricultural market prices and trends The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the ChancayHuaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation enabling them to coordinate their actions More than 13000 rural inhabitants as well as 18000 students in the region will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure The 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September The nongovernment organisation Cepes Peruvian Centre for Social Studies led the 200000 project also backed by local institutions the Education and Agriculture ministries and European development organisations The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system said Carlos Saldarriaga technical coordinator at Cepes Farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres aims to make the network selfsustainable within three years through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes One of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System with its flagship huaralorg website There farmers can find the prices for local produce as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques The system also helps the inhabitants of the ChancayHuaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems Water is the main element that unites them all It is a precious element in Perus coastal areas because it is so scarce and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world Cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the projects success Throughout the last three years the people have provided a vital thrust to the project they feel it belongs to them said Mr Saldarriaga The community training sessions attended by an equal number of men and women have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm We have had an excellent response mainly from young people But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50year old women who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives So far the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers organisations in Peru This is a pilot project and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places underlined Mr Saldarriaga The Cepes researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo a 50family community with no electricity during the construction of the local telecentre site There it was necessary to build a minihydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers the communications equipment and the cabin lights It was already dark when the technicians realised they didnt have any light bulbs to test the generator so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs recalls Carlos Saldarriaga The logical answer was we dont sell any so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing Now with the wireless network Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated

tech,Robots learn robotiquette rules,Robots are learning lessons on robotiquette how to behave socially so they can mix better with humans By playing games like passtheparcel a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations The studys findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in humanrobot interaction The work is part of the European Cogniron robotics project and was on show at Londons Science Museum We are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists said Professor Kerstin Dautenhahn project leader at Hertfordshire Our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans The research also focuses on human perception of robots including how they should look and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator Without such studies you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds Professor Dautenhahn told BBC News Online And I want robots to treat humans as human beings and not like other robots she added In most situations a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person but also with groups of people To find out how they would react the Hertfordshire Cogniron team taught one robot to play passtheparcel with children Showing off its skills at the Science Museum the unnamed robot had to select approach and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye It even used speech to give instructions and play music However according to researchers it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the robotiquette for human interaction If you think of a robot as a companion for the human being you can think of 20 years into the future concluded Professor Dautenhahn It might take even longer because it is very very hard to develop such a robot You can hear more on this story on the BBC World Services Go Digital programme
tech,Podcasts mark rise of DIY radio,An Apple iPod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10000 songs which is a lot of space to fill But more and more iPod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers It is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ video jockey Adam Curry Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod although you do not need an iPod to create one or to listen to a podcast A podcast is basically an internetbased radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home They need only a microphone a PC and some editing software They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free Using technology based on XML computer code and RSS Really Simple Syndication listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which Mr Curry has pioneered The latest MP3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically Mr Curry records hosts edits and produce a daily 40 minute podcast called The Daily Source Code He wants to make podcasting the Next Big Thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry I was always into technologies and wires he explains My parents gave me the Radio Shack 101 project kit which allows you to build an AM transmitter and subsequently an FM transmitter I had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio Mr Curry is American but he grew up in the Netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the Dutch capital He tried university in the US and ended up back in Holland where he hosted a music video show He spent the next seven years in New York where he worked at MTV hosting the Top 20 Video Countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet At a certain point in 1995 I was driving in on a Friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid You know Im going do the Top 20 Countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning So after I finished the show I quit I said on air its been great Ive been here for seven years at that point theres something on the internet Ive got to go find it and Ill see you later But Mr Currys technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and highspeed internet connections were becoming more widely available The MP3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before Most importantly Mr Curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing Listen to 99 of the radio that you hear today its radio voices and its fake its just fake He wanted to make it easier for people to find real voices on the internet He wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like iPods Mr Curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him No one did so he tried to write one himself He finished it a few months ago and says it totally sucked He put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it the result is a work in progress called ipodder Doug Kaye a Californiabased podcaster praises the former MTV VJ for what he has done Adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem Ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the MP3 player he explains People can wake up in the morning pick up their iPods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that theres all this new content automatically put onto their players It is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in Australia Finland Brazil even Malaysia One couple broadcasts theirs The Dawn and Drew Show from Wisconsin in the US sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed Topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners Already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts Chris McIntyre runs Podcast Alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological knowhow to simply listen If I were to tell my mom or my motherinlaw to copy an XML or RSS file to their podcast aggregator they would think I was speaking a foreign language Mr McIntyre says Along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music Some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the antiradio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting Already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world Heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is Playboy For his part Adam Currys pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be He loves doing The Daily Source Code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences He has even been called the Ed Sullivan or Johnny Carson of podcasting which he says is a badge Ill wear with great honour To be the Johnny Carson or Ed Sullivan of anything is wonderful And you know what You dont need a hell of a lot of talent You just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine And thats good for me Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World a BBC World Service and WGBHBoston coproduction

tech,Solutions to net security fears,Fake bank emails or phishing and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say ebusiness experts Trust in online security is falling as a result Almost 70 of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people The survey of more than 1000 people reported that 43 were not willing to hand over personal information online It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm RSA which carried out the poll An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging ecommerce and ebanking are being taken seriously by banks in particular I dont think the threat is overplayed Barry Beal global security manager for Capgemini told the BBC News website He added The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves If we do that they will indemnify us he said Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individuals identity Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget Last year a street survey found that more than 70 of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate On average people have to remember four different passwords Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer In a separate survey by RSA 80 said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems For many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard Activcard is just one of the many companies like RSA Security which has been trying to come up with just that RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a onetime passcode generation service Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds Many companies use a tokenbased method already for employees to access networks securely already Activcards method is more complex It is currently trailing its onetime passcode generation technology with UK banks Steve Ash from Activcard told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes It combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions You take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given If you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction The clever bit happens back at the banks secure servers The code is validated by the banks systems matching the information they expect with the customers unique key Each individual gets a key which is unique to them It is a 2048bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said Mr Ash It means that in a typical security attack explains Mr Ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode By the time they go back to use the information the code has expired so they cant prove who they are according to Mr Ash In the next few years Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use PCs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards The gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants PDAs and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said

business,Feta cheese battle reaches court,A row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name The Commissions decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term with the cheese produced widely outside Greece The Commissions controversial 2002 ruling gave protected designation of origin status to feta cheese made in Greece effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there From 2007 onwards Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese Hans Arne Kristiansen a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board told the BBC Denmark is Europes second largest producer of feta after Greece producing about 30000 tonnes a year and exports its products to Greece It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation Mr Kristiansen said That is just one of the costs The case will also have a major impact on Britains sole feta producer Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses Judy Bell the companys founder said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product If we lose we will have to go through a massive remerchandising process and reorganisation she said We have never tried to pull the wool over anyones eyes its very clear from the label that its Yorkshire feta The original decision was a victory for Greece where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6000 years Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goats milk and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine Greece makes 115000 tonnes mainly for domestic consumption The Court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn
business,Japanese growth grinds to a halt,Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decadelong trough Output in the period grew just 01 an annual rate of 03 Exports the usual engine of recovery faltered while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short The growth falls well short of expectations but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion The economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums One result was deflation prices falling rather than rising which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery But high oil prices have knocked 02 off the growth rate while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive The performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year The first quarter showed annual growth of 63 with the second showing 11 and economists had been predicting as much as 2 this time around Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker said Hiromichi Shirakawa chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo Personal consumption looks good but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics The amber light is flashing The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japans massive public debt

sport,Ireland win eclipses refereeing errors,The International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go bellyup It may have to go the whole way and have NFLstyle video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles What the IRB does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself Sundays explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948 The game was as exciting as it comes with a muchimproved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way One can understand that frustration There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 1913 victory but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sports blazers Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece I doubt whether Kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made After all he has no public recourse to criticism It was the same for Simon McDowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France As far as England were concerned there were queries over Mark Cuetos first halfeffort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick England coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup On that occasion David Humphreys kicked to Tommy Bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end Lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control However one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny OConnor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown But in rugby everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes The referee also missed Englands Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan OGara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line Those were the standout moments in a classic game between the two old foes But there were many more and one should not take away from those Brian ODriscolls winning try was as wellconceived as they come while Charlie Hodgsons brilliant kicking display was another highlight And Ronan OGaras tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component But the defining moments came with Ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on The first was Denis Hickies brilliant double tackle in the righthand corner He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson crossfield kick then regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try Irelands secondrow colossus Paul OConnell was equally superb England had turned Ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers Unfortunately he ran into OConnell who hit him hard very hard and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover That spoke volumes about Irelands backfoot display with defensive coach Mike Ford taking a bow at the end To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward It may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships

business,Fed warns of more US rate rises,The US looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005 according to the Federal Reserve Minutes of the December meeting which pushed rates up to 225 showed that policymakers at the Fed are worried about accelerating inflation The clear signal pushed the dollar up to 13270 to the euro by 0400 GMT on Wednesday but depressed US shares The markets are starting to fear a more aggressive Fed in 2005 said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research The Dow Jones index dropped almost 100 points on Tuesday with the Nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades The dollar also gained ground against sterling on Tuesday reaching 18832 to the pound before slipping slightly on Wednesday morning The release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 December meeting was much faster than usual indicating the Fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking This too is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come The key Fed funds rate has risen 125 percentage points during 2004 from the 46year low of 1 reached not long after the 911 attacks in 2001 That long trough might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risktaking in financial markets said the Federal Open Markets Committee FOMC which sets interest rates The odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early February economists said But the respite for the dollar which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive US trade and budget deficits may be shortlived You cant rule out a further correction but we dont think its a change in direction in the dollar said Jason Daw at Merrill Lynch Nothing fundamental has changed
entertainment,German music in a zombie state,The German music business the third largest in the world is in the state of a zombie because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy a leading industry figure has said Tim Renner the head of Universal Music Germany until last year told BBC World Services The Music Biz programme that the countrys music industry was now struggling to survive Renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties such as downloading its decline could become irreversible The problem the music industry has got is that they arent willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out he stated So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie The music market in Germany peaked in 1997 with sales of 26bn euros 18bn Since 2000 sales have plummeted to just 16bn euros 11bn in 2003 In the space of one year between 2002 and 2003 CD album sales fell by 138 But a study by the Society for Consumer Research found that at the same time more than twice as many recordable CDs had music recorded on them than CD albums were sold Mr Renner pointed out that because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a goodselling record this was particularly damaging You need time he added However Peter Zombic the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as Mr Renner believed Its quite true that we have severe problems in Germany but thats true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too he argued We have a severe problem with piracy especially internet piracy and we also have a severe problem of private copying I dont agree that the music industry lost control over the music market in fact especially in regard to Germany talent the market is quite successful He did however admit that copyright owners have partly lost control of their copyright due to piracy and copying But he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading We were the first to implement a download service back in 1997 he argued At that time it was not successful because of the advent of piracy it was the Napster time when P2P services became popular It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem German law does allow people to make copies of CDs for their family and close friends without fear of breaking copyright Mr Zombic said that this legal framework was a huge problem There is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby its nice its fun he added We try to make clear its not nice and its not fun its endangering the creativity in our country
entertainment,Roundabout continues nostalgia trip,The new bigscreen version of The Magic Roundabout released in the UK on Friday is the latest attempt to turn childrens television into boxoffice gold Recent years have seen a lessthansuccessful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show Thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of E Nesbits Five Children and It previously filmed by the BBC in 1991 HeMan and Transformers which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s will soon receive their own costly makeovers With screen versions of The ATeam The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blakes Seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business But some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals The new version of The Magic Roundabout which will be released as Sprung in the US replaces the stopmotion models of the 1960s TV show with polished computergenerated animation In a similar fashion the 2004 Thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the originals puppets and models The films are squarely pitched at younger audiences Pop stars Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue provide voices in The Magic Roundabout while the nowdefunct boy band Busted performed the Thunderbirds theme song But while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash This CGanimated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stopmotion Roundabout a cult hit writes Stella Papamichael on the BBC Movies site And the recent puppet comedy Team America World Police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that Gerry Andersons Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins Dan Jolin reviews editor of Empire magazine says classic childrens TV shows have a builtin audience that make them ideal for reinvention I can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today But I think its backfiring Whats next The Clangers on some distant planet with some giant CGI Soup Dragons chasing after them Despite Thunderbirds disappointing global boxoffice performance the film cost 42m 22m but only recouped 21m 11m the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating It can therefore be only a matter of time before some other TV favourites receive the Hollywood treatment After the success of Garfield The Movie Britains shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle With only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat Professor Yaffle and the Mice of the Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ Furry recyclers have already had one bigscreen outing 1977s Wombling Free But with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback Advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the BBCs supernatural comedy And the success of Pirates of the Caribbean must surely herald a comeback for TVs most popular cartoon buccaneer It might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed The Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February How about bringing Catweazle to the big screen He could give Gandalf a run for his money Thundercats I loved it Should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth back Get your hands off the Clangers Is nothing sacred Make a movie version of the Banana splits What about Keanu Reeves and Richard Gere in a remake of The Wooden Tops Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy You forgot to mention the grearest of them all Danger Mouse But then again it couldnt be better than the original series could it Its always nice to see these old toons rereleased but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie and the song I think Ive been completely put off Just leave these classics alone as good memories I think remakes are a good idea As the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe I believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular As long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series Personally id like to see cartoons such as Transformers Thundercats and MASK get full Hollywood remakes Leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place The thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson Love to see Transformers with real actors and CGI And make it at least a 15 rating Part of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect They were moody sarcastic and rather human Just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved Dougal never smiled like that Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place I have fond memories of Bod not least of which because I look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film Its got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story Bod would likely be played by Tom Cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two Its all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation It does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are filmmakers running out of original ideas All I can say is bring back Danger Mouse probably the greatest kids show ever I recently rewatched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child There WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back Again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation this time computer created flatcell like animation failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate We live in a sampling world the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new It got to be MrBenn The story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great And who to play the lead role Well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin If its going to be an adventure then Johnny Depp playing a role similar to the Pirates Of The Caribbean Character Muffin the Mule perhaps After all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know Why cant the British film industry try making Gerry Andersons UFO or Captain Scarlet or Saphire and Steel or The Tomorrow People In todays media it seems the past is the future TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes DJs are sampling or reworking 70s and 80s music Even computer games from 1015 years ago are getting modern reworkings Personally I think it shows that no one has any originality any more Why not just leave our mistyeyed nostalgia alone Mary Mungo and Midge But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs Plus would Mary be more of a Vicky Pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block Yeah but no but I wasnt even there Id like to see Mr Benn with Brad Pitt in the title role Sean Connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner It demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in todays filmmakers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia There are plany of modern childrens book that would make excellent films or TV programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the past Mr Benn with Rowan Atkinson as the lead Would have loved to see Dungeons Dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didnt come up to scratch The only one that isnt to be remade as yet is Thundercats which Id like to see Im an expat living in Norway and I recently went through a period of buying the DVDs of many of my favourite childrens programs for my 2 daughters My dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen Very Scandinavian Rainbow I believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie popular among children because its original witty and modern The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago How about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies Rentaghost Terrahawks Bodoh the list could go on and on If a Transformers movie is indeed on the cards then Ill be the first one on Amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch Repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price I dont care Till then Ill have to make do with the Citreon C4 advert Id luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same And who remembers Trap Door voiced by the late Willie Rushden superb childrens programme Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie Or even Jamie and the Magic Torchhmmmmm I could go on and on Danger Mouse At 34 Im showing my age Noggin the Nog was one of the best childrens programs The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that noone could approach Oliver Postgates wonderful voices So in general leave well alone The originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story Just imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more lifelike Fingermouse Bob the Builder Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks In the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns Krusty and Gobo Will they triumph or will they fail miserably Find out this Fall One puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90 It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joes car Of course Gerry Andersons Supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of bigscreen bigbudget action It was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a childrent movie that really let it down After all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves Its only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isnt it Id hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation I love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldnt recreate the magic Perhaps if the remakes were done in a Look Around You mockauthentic style I might be interested Chorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch that would be mega This regurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other peoples ideas because it guarantees to bring in the The same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material Will Young etc The sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the shortterm The fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant eg Starsky Hutch Hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it I pray they never do a remake of Chorlton And The Wheelies Im only 27 and dont remember the series from when it was on TV but have the set on DVD and its a classic The fact its so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to todays stuff it looks amateurish Thats the appeal though its so innocent like Chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it

politics,Vouchers to cut winter deaths,Pensioners are being promised energy savings by the Liberal Democrats as snow and cold temperatures continue The party says the plans could save the average pensioner 100 every year and cut winter deaths The government gives 200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60 or 300 where people are over 80 The Tories promise to keep the payments The Lib Dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey said The current scheme has helped some older people but this new Liberal Democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes The plan would boost energy conservation says the party and insulation could save 100 every year for pensioner households so using the money more intelligently than at present

politics,Debate needed on donations cap,A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said Fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit In a new report the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a 10000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning There were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001 2002 and 2003 with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report If there was to be a cap it should be 10000 a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003 Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more smallscale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200 It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons European Parliament Scottish Parliament Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters The report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll as happens with other elections Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system
tech,US woman sues over cartridges,A US woman is suing Hewlett Packard HP saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date The unnamed woman from Georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs refilling even when it does not The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001 HP the worlds biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a builtin expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said The lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as 34 but it could cost up to 1700 in running costs over an 18month period due to cartridge a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year The inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the UKs Office of Fair Trading OFT which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers

tech,Apple laptop is greatest gadget,The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by US magazine Mobile PC The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs The magazine has compiled an alltime top 100 list of gadgets which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two Gadgets needed moving parts andor electronics to warrant inclusion The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a selfcontained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device In general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine In the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded The oldest gadget in the top 100 is the abacus which the magazine dates at 190 AD and put in 60th place Other preelectronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 59th position the marine chronometer from 1761 42nd position and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 28th position The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10 which also includes the first flash mp3 player Diamound Multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera Casio QV10 and mobile phone Motorola Startac The most popular gadget of the moment the Apple iPod is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13 Sonys third entry in the top 20 is the CDP101 CD player from 1983 Who can forget the crystalline hissfree blast of Madonnas Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player asked the magazine Karl Elseners knife the Swiss Army Knife from 1891 is at number 20 in the list Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone 23rd the Nintendo GameBoy 25th and the Pulsar quartz digital watch 36th The list also contains plenty of oddities the Pez sweet dispenser 98th 1980s toy Tamagotchi 86th and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler 84th Why worry about mobile phones Soon they will be subsumed into the PDAs laptops etc What about the Marine Chronometer Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries For its time a technological marvel Sony Net Minidisc It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market I always used my NetMD and could not go anywhere without it A laptop computer is not a gadget Its a working tool The Sinclair Executive was the worlds first pocket calculator I think this should be there as well How about the clockwork radio Or GPS Or a pocket calculator All these things are useful to real people not just PC magazine editors Are the people who created this list insane Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone It has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop From outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker An interesting list Of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc the Tandy 100 The size of A4 paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible Whats an Apple Powerbook 100 Its out of date not much of a gadget Surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener Swiss Army Knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves It has to be the mobile phone No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980 A true gadget it could be carried around and shown off All top 10 are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current hightech obsession than anyhting else I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20 Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time The first home machine with a true multitakings OS Shame the marketing was so bad Apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else Utter rubbish Yes the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed No competition Id also put Apples Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason I only wish that Vulcan Incs Flipstart wasnt just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise What about radios and TVs The swiss army knife By far the most useful gadget I got mine 12 years ago Still wearing and using it a lot It stood the test of time Psion Organiser series 3 should be up there Had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable Case design was good batteries in the hinge a first I think Great product innovation The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers oferr mobile PC Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site Its obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that The Motorola Startac should be Number One Why There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices The Psion series 3c The first most practical way to carry all your info around I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now Id have put the mobile phone high up the list Probably a Nokia model Sinclair Spectrum 16k It plugged into the tv Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and thats what I do for a living now I wish more modern notebooks even Apples newest offerings were more like the PB100 Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses Theyre invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use Congratulations to Apple a deserved win

politics,Terror powers expose tyranny,The Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest where there isnt enough evidence to put them on trial Lord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties But thriller writer Frederick Forsyth tells BBC News of his personal response to the move There is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of Britain Or so says Home Secretary Charles Clarke My reaction So what It is not that I am cynical or just do not care I care about this country very much But in the 66 years that I have been alive there has not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there has not been a threat aimed at us My point is the British have always coped without becoming a dictatorship We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat But that is what the Blair government now seeks to do create a tyranny to defend us from the alQaeda tyranny I was born on 25 August 1938 The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler A week after my first birthday the threat had become reality We were at war My father wore a uniform for five years After 1945 we yearned for peace at last But in 1946 Winston Churchill told us from the Baltic to the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across Europe Behind the Iron Curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat Josef Stalin triggered the Cold War with the Berlin blockade in 1948 My whole generation was blighted by it We were threatened by the nuclear holocaust the nuclear wind the nuclear winter We built shelters that would have sheltered nothing We spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals We took silly precautions Some fought it some marched futilely against it Some pretended it was not there The Cold War lasted 43 years but we remained a parliamentary democracy By the early seventies it was terrorism as well Al Fatah Black September Red Brigades but most of all for us the IRA and the INLA Thirty more years 300 policemen and women over 600 soldiers more than 3000 civilians dead but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny That was why the tyrants lost Civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible Evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources yes and one judge nojury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised Informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle But habeas corpus did not die right of appeal was not abolished Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism Its leaders want to destroy our society so did the IRA It is based and funded abroad so was the IRA It has sleeper fanatics inside our society so did the IRA It is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents so was the IRA The prime movers are not easy to bring to trial neither were the IRA But we did And without becoming a tyranny Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge but the whim of a political activist called a government minister To be protected from terror the government says we must become a tyranny But a tyranny is based on the citizens terror This is not victory this is defeat before a shot is fired An interesting article its good to see widening participation in the debate but I suggest we move one step further Our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace because invading foreign nations imprisoning the innocent and hunting in the shadows cannot destroy an evil of the mind and hatred within the heart Rather than focusing upon effect we should consider the cause because terrorism does not begin with bombs Why not try a foreign policy of compassion it can only enhance our democracy and share our freedom I agree with Frederick Forsyth We really cant deal with terrorism by turning Britain into a fascist state What we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably isnt any Our security services behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it while the real villain gets away Remember there were no WMD in Iraq Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist In this overly politically correct society it is good to see someone like Mr Forsyth speak out Yes there has been oppression by the British government in the past and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland but yes we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without chargetrial etc apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal for exampleThis country signs up to human rights and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people defined by whom When ID cards become mandatory the data collected will not be protected by the Data Protection Act and will be readily available to people like GCHQ with no control by the person whose ID is being checked The threat now is new You cannot compare the threats of past years with now Forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism 3000 people died in one morning in NY on September 11th 2001 The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology A Kilo of Semtex will flatten a building a Kilo of plutonium will flatten a city You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible I agree the government is probably encouraging a degree of masshysteria and talking up the threat but talkingdown the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too The problem with this issue is not that it isnt important but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times that we will just let this go without telling the government no However as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far As somebody of Chinese origin I can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life Whilst life wasnt perfect we could make better for ourselves Now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do We have to be politicallycorrect and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions We have a Prime Minister who spends too much time meddling in US politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of British Citizens at home or abroad Mr Forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions Lets hope the BBC doesnt get gagged for letting people express their views The people have the right to know and the BBCs role is to Inform Educate and Entertain I agree Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties In the end the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy The terrorists have already won I absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth Yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate The idea that the new terrorism demands new powers is erroneous The evidence of any real terrorist capability in the UK is scant Ricin for example is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear If the government has its way with ID cards tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not We will have lost the precious freedom which Bush and Blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court That goes right back to Magna Carta and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew best When you look at todays Britain you realise George Orwell was only wrong about one thing the date Frederick Forsyth puts it beautifully The government is seeking to introduce a police state The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases together with the unBritish idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years We are sleepwalking into this Wake up An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat 1 If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance These people will use devastating force against us without fear of ANY consequence 2 The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it Because these terrorists are potentially SO deadly we have to come up with new tougher responses It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London has been nuked We wont have much of a society left to debate Hes correct in most of what he says Mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in Northern Ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young Catholics to join the IRA Administrative detention of Muslims could have a similar effect now Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest and for how longThey were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack I dont usually have much time for Mr Forsyths largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on There is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the UK but it is very doubtful whether alQaeda is a global organisation coordinating this The rise of surveillance cameras ID cards the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times this is the stuff of nightmares Add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the Home Secretary and I genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit Where will this end As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the UK its government will soon have its people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation but could not verbalise Thank you Mr Forsyth seems to forget that killings in the Troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides He also forgets basic Human Rights were suspended then as now Experienced Judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times For very little return and maximum alienation These laws and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same Forsyth is wrong The nature of the current threat is new It is no longer to our armed forces as the Soviet threat in the Eastern bloc was It is to you and I The terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately The best comparison is therefore the blitz 1941 At this time let us not forget suspects foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war without any complaints from the public We must not forget we are at war Id say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major UK target is a When not an If probability Ill bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didnt do enough to protect the UK People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live is under attack not from terrorists but from this government The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the alleged terrorists are doing but from our own government I believe what this government is doing is at the very least highly questionable and at worst sinister At what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the British Isles when we are all tagged and monitored constantly Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing It should be of great concern to everyone I am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him I am against a police state and would not like to think that I lived in one I think that the attack on Iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism How true There are extremely worrying parallels between Britain now and Germany during the 30s I never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within Mr Forsyth has forgotten one key point the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler Stalin and the IRA all failed As a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not That does not mean that the civil liberties of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resort But to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of todays terrorists we may need to do things a little differently Let us hope not Frederic Forsythes comments seem to me to be a wellthoughtout analysis of why we human society as a whole and Britain in particular should resist the temptation to overprotect through fear It is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all forms as Mr Forsythes opening comments suggest I am reminded of a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson A nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither The government are faced with an incredibly difficult task and have made a policy to deal with it Its all very well criticising that policy but if Mr Forsythe cant draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative I say So what to his opinions Frederick Forsyths rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable He distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against New Labour This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist because he does not appreciate the need for balance I rarely find myself agreeing with My Forsyth but in this instance I think he is correct The rule of law must prevail civil liberties are worth defending If the government can hold suspects without charge or trial whats next I agree absolutely By introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror Our democratic system is not perfect but as Churchill points out it is better than all the others that have been tried Terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom I do not usually agree with Mr Forsyth but he is spot on here The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose Totalitarianism always requires an outside threat justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation Although in principle I agree with him Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point alQaeda attacks though obviously there have been none yet in the UK seek to kill the maximum number of people The IRA wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement Yes I agree with Mr Forsyths views I do not believe the governments plans are justified There is over reaction to and the negative influence of the US Presidents interpretation of democracy and freedom He uses the same arguments that were current before the WWII the Wars to liberate Iraq Afghanistan with Syria and Iran to come We are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who Mr Forsyth seems to be putting along side the scruffy little Austrian Thomas Hobbes would be smiling in his grave at Labours propositions Like New Labour he called himself a libertarian Like New Labour he believed he was promoting the peoples best interests But as Forsythe criticises this government Hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians Simply put he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty the liberty to live man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign as protection against his fellow barbaric man Hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity and rightly so I hope New Labour suffers the same treatment I agree with Mr Forsyths views The governments approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy They must not be allowed to get away with it Of course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and hes wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny Has he forgotten about shoot to kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squads etc My background is somewhat similar to Freddies so I am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments We can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms Whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive it is unfortunately also the first step towards totalitarianism Who is to decide whom is a suspect Why should we believe them Who can have faith in the honesty integrity and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years What is to stop false denunciations What of those falsely accused who will lose their careers Who will support their families Will their children still go to school It smacks to me of the methods of Nazi Germany Stalins Russia Ceausescus Romania the list goes on It looks as if a new dark age is coming I see that opinion on Mr Forsyths remarks are divided The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they dont like or are scared of But history has shown that if you have laws like that they always get abused by those in power After all today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you And that day youll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice Our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces you have to be shown to be deserving of it If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we are no better that those we are fighting I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth but Im in wholehearted agreement with him on this one We as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro US propaganda which of course also means well inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our governments of any political persuasion incidentally to gradually and insidiously impose a police state by well tried tested back door methods I grieve for the future of my children its no wonder theyre adamant they dont ever want any of their own This government with much fanfare signs us up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial This puts it on a par with the government of Burma Like many of your respondents I wouldnt usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share but in the instance of opposing Charles Clarks proposals for house arrest I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth I agree with Mr Forsyth Just look at the facts our government along with the US invaded another sovereign country Iraq by selecting intelligence that backed its case based on fear The facts turned out to be very different If individuals are treated in the same distorted way then weve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs We become animals too I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent it is hypocrisy of the highest order Mr Forsyth links Islamic fundamentalism to the new threat However it appears that he has misunderstood the term Islamic fundamentalism It should be pointed out that a Muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the Quraan and the teachings of the last Prophet Muhammad is an Islamic Fundamentalist This person does not commit suicide in any shape or form nor does shehe kill innocent women men and children This person is selfreflective and constantly tries to better herhis actions by being good to others The people who Mr Forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of Islam They have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions On top of that they claim to be following Islam in its true form I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference in Northern Ireland internment certainly didnt achieve anything the bombings didnt stop and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London it is easy to agree with him he is absolutely spot on During the IRA bombings there were massive explosions in Canary Wharf to the right of where I write this and also to the left in the City of London Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq Even when England was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like We have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including ID cards which Winston Churchill decided had to go since he said the average Bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities incidentally I can still remember my old ID card number Hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered What can I add to Mr Forsyths eloquently put arguments except applause Well done that man for standing up and being counted in the war against tyranny

tech,Remote control rifle range debuts,Soon you could go hunting via the net A Texas company is considering letting web users use a remotecontrolled rifle to shoot down deer antelope and wild pigs For a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133hectare Texas ranch The LiveShot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet John Underwood the man behind the LiveShot website said the idea for the remotecontrol hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site We were looking at a beautiful whitetail buck and my friend said If you just had a gun for that A little light bulb went off in my head Mr Underwood told the Reuters news agency A years work and 10000 has resulted in a remotecontrolled rig on which sits a camera and 22 calibre rifle Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals Also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig Each remote hunting session will cost 150 with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work Species that can be shot will include barbary Corsican and mouflon sheep blackbuck antelope and wild pigs Already the LiveShot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for 595 for each 20minute shooting session For further fees users can get the target they shot and a DVD recording of their session Handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed offrange or at something it should not be Mr Underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to Texas In a statement the RSPCA said it had grave concerns about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle We assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a clean kill something the RSPCA accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport it said Animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily said the statement Mike Berger wildlife director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting He said state laws on hunting only covered regulated animals such as native deer and bird species As such there was nothing to stop Mr Underwood letting people hunt unregulated imported animals and wild pigs Mr Underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals
tech,US woman sues over ink cartridges,A US woman is suing Hewlett Packard HP saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date The unnamed woman from Georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs refilling even when it does not The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001 HP the worlds biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a builtin expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said The lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as 34 but it could cost up to 1700 in running costs over an 18month period due to cartridge a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year The inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the UKs Office of Fair Trading OFT which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers
tech,Big war games battle it out,The arrival of new titles in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice The acclaimed PC title Call of Duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the originals elements For its part the longrunning Medal of Honor series has added Pacific Assault to its PC catalogue adapting the console game Rising Sun Call of Duty Finest Hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on World War 2 battlefronts including Russia and North Africa It is a traditional firstpersonviewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you On a nearidentical note Medal of Honor Pacific Assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tightknit team and plum in the middle of allout action Its arenas are the wars Pacific battles including Guadalcanal and Pearl Harbour You play one character throughout a raw and rather talkative US soldier Both games rely on a carefully stagemanaged structure that keeps things ticking along When this works it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story When it does not it is tedious A winning moment is an early scene in Pacific Assault where you come under attack at the famous US base in Hawaii You are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of Japanese planes then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the antiaircraft guns It is one of the finest setpieces ever seen in a video game This notion of shuffling the player along a studiously predetermined path forcibly witnessing a series of preset moments of action is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic The genius of something like Half Life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection This pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting a fullon atmospheric experience Call of Duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation Finest Hour has a similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voiceovers Letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the Call of Duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat The games drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on PC The mouse control is a big reason why along with the sharper graphics a topend computer can muster and the apparent notion that PC games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety Call of Duty on PC was more detailed plotwise and graphically and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready Targeting with the PS2 controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collisiondetection You can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him Checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again The game wants to be a challenge and is and many players will like it for that It is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its PC parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive Both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour And in Pacific Assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless But the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all Of the two games Pacific Assault gets more things right including little points like autosaving intelligently and having tidier presentation It engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious Far Cry although we had to ramp up the settings on a highspec machine to get the most out of them Finest Hour is by no means bad and it is only because the PC original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming Those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented But they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent

prize asset Parry revealed Real Madrid did ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes He said They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes but the response to Real Madrid was the same Steven is not for sale But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season Parry said I sincerely hope he will be Steven knows my views He knows Rafas views We have reaffirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him We crave success as much as he does We know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than hed like to do anything else We all want to see progress by next season Hes not alone in that There are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a 30mplus bid in the summer but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven most of which have been complete myths It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer We didnt had an offer last summer Parry explained We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him In reality it didnt go beyond that Maybe there will be an offer in the summer Maybe there wont Our position is we want Steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will That just doesnt work but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda You can forget that Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpools new stadium in Stanley Park which is set to open in 2007 And he confessed Arsenals 100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the Anfield club serious food for thought He said I have to say historically it is something I have been against and I have been on record as saying that but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eyeopener I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow thats interesting My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but Parry countered I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it Time will tell I think the stadium will always be Anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship I think it would be remiss not to Thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but I think it is clearly something we have to explore On the subject of possible new investment Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the Middle East That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board He also accused Liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but Parry explained Steve has never been used as a stalking horse Theres no need and that is not the way we do business We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004 I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen Quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it We are still evaluating it Steves interest was taken very much on its own merits His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold The door isnt closed on anything We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful Thats a dream we all share so as far as Im concerned the door is not closed I would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him As for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for Gerrard I dont care who you are the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be We cannot let that sum of money go despite Gerrards quality Through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which I think is the right thing to do Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term I am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash 50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it I would however be happy with Gerrards transfer for any fee over 35m Parrys statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry I would keep Gerrard No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy Clearly if he isnt then we would be foolish not to sell The worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible nonChampions League football

below If you think of Snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise This is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time Even before Nokias NGage game phone launched in late 2003 many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market That audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can Life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed Now sites such as Wireless Gaming Review list more than 200 different titles for some UK networks and the ranges suit every possible taste There are ports of PC and arcade classics such as Space Invaders Lunar Lander and Bejewelled There are also versions of titles such as Colin McRae Rally that you typically find on PCs and consoles There are shootemups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tiein Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost 5 What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset Far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use 3D graphics The minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too Now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile Many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others Usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via Bluetooth shortrange radio technology With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS DIGITAL BRIDGES As soon as I start playing this I remember why I never play driving games because Im rubbish at them No matter if I drive the car via joystick or keypad I just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit Winning gives you cash for upgrades Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background The cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track The only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play FATAL FORCE MACROSPACE A futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth Graphics are a bit cartoonlike but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring Both background music and sounds effects work well The scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the Fatal Force commanders Weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while With the right powerup you can go into a Matrixstyle bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range Online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps

tech,Blogger grounded by her airline,A US airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary Queen of the Sky otherwise known as Ellen Simonetti evolved into an anonymous semifictional account of life in the sky But after she posted pictures of herself in uniform Delta Airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay Ms Simonetti was told her suspension was a result of inappropriate images Delta Airlines declined to comment I was really shocked I had no warning Ms Simonetti told BBC News Online I never thought I would get in trouble because of the blog I thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action The issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites Ms Simonetti was suspended on 25 September pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC A spokesperson for Delta Airlines told BBC News Online All I can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media She added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past Ms Simonetti started her personal blog in January to help her get over her mothers death She had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies The airlines name was changed to Anonymous Airline and the city in which she was based was called Quirksville A large part of the blog contained fictional stories because Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to Ms Simonetti The images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother We often take pictures on flight or on layovers I just though why not include them on my blog for fun I never meant it as something to harm my company and dont understand how they think it did harm them Ms Simonetti said She has also claimed that pictures of male Delta Airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web Of the 10 or so images on the site only one showed Ms Simonettis flight wings They did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with I am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up she said The images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended As far as Ms Simonetti knows there is no company antiblogging policy There is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear Jeffrey Matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the University of Dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees There are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers he said It was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy You have to remember that as an employee you dont have total free speech anymore he said Mr Matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog One of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they employees do cross the line He speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of Ms Simonetti in uniform were posted Whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line he said Ms Simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs One of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken If they had asked me just take down the blog I would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option she said This blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it If I had known it would cost me my job I would not have done that

politics,Student fee factor played down,A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland However Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out Applications from England and Wales rose by 17 between January 2005 and the previous year up 23600 to 27700 Fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid topup fees of up to 3000 a year being introduced in England In June last year Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by 2000 in an attempt to prevent a crossborder flood although no figure has yet been agreed Legislation to introduce the topup fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all The figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas Universities Scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out Director David Caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities but this was not a major factor He told BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland programme The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by topup fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated However it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge an additional figure of about 200 Also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales where there are no plans for topup fees have also risen by 19 Mr Wallace said Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held not just in Britain We want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students

politics,Child access laws shakeup,Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied Lord Falconer said The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday He denied fathers activists had forced the changes telling the BBC there is a recognition that something is wrong Between 15000 and 20000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4s Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court But he opposed compulsory mediation saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude Other plans include Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements based on reallife examples that have worked in the past Extending incourt conciliation more informal hearings before contested court cases Better access to legal emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a nuclear option which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the childs interests a spokesman said The aim of the new legislation was to provide a medium range of penalties such as fines community service orders compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews Failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents Lord Falconer said Tagging may be going too far but lets have a debate about that Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published in the next two weeks a spokesman said The governments proposals have met with disapproval from fathers rights groups John Ison from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice said It is very disappointing What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation Jim Parton from Families Need Fathers said the new proposals lacked compulsion We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order then you know where you stand you know what the minimum access is Otherwise you see people make agreements which then fall apart Mr Parton said he had been told by Childrens Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election which is likely to take place in May The Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law Theresa May shadow secretary for the family told BBC Radio 4s Today programme that the governments plans were inadequate and were papering over the cracks of the current system She said a Conservative government would bring a radical reform of the family courts as well as enforcing a legal presumption of coparenting and compulsory mediation We want to make courts the last resort rather than the first resort she added The government says children cannot simply be divided up like property when a marriage collapses The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules rather than having rigid targets
tech,Who do you think you are,The real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst Bill Thompson It is what happens when it arrives at the other end The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data The fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society our identities Armed with the personal details that a bank holds plus a fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone elses name And it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving Identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish But however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble It is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a wellplaced insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system In fact I suspect that the FSA is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time Has anyone checked Bob Cratchits family links to the criminal underworld I wonder And it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted Health authorities government agencies and of course the big ecommerce sites like Amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters The good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files Companies like SecureWave for example can restrict the use of USB ports just to authorised devices or even to an individuals personal memory card These solutions are not perfect but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system However the warning does highlight one of the major issues with ecommerce and online trading the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the back office It has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked In fact I do not know of a single case where an email containing payment details has led to card fraud There are simply too many emails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud CD Universe Powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name Whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused Any organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it Unauthorised disclosure is not allowed but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the Act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice This is not something we can just leave it to the market The consequences of having ones identity stolen are too serious and markets respond too slowly After all I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems I doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft I have never felt comfortable with the US practice of suing everything that moves partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients so I know which Id prefer Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital

tech,China to overtake US net use,The Chinese netusing population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years says a report Chinas net users number 100m but this represents less than 8 of the countrys 13 billion people Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the 137 million US users of the net by 2008 The report says that the countrys culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations Already net use in China has a very different character than in many Western nations said William Makower chief executive of Panlogic In many Western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work By contrast in China workplace machines are relatively rare This combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China Only 36 of Chinese homes have telephones according to reports Net usage tends to happen in the evening said Mr Makower they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf Its fundamentally different usage to what we have here he said Net use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the countrys eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities The net is key to helping Chinese people keep in touch with friends said Mr Makower Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes What people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of Chinese life For instance said Mr Makower credit cards are rare in China partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt The most popular way to pay is CashOnDelivery he said and thats quite a brake to the development of ecommerce The arrival of foreign banks in China due in 2006 could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said Mr Makower But if Chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on Western ways of living A large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar he said Generally its more difficult for the government to be able to control it Its real value is as an open window onto whats happening elsewhere in the world he said Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else Familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet Its a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it said Mr Makower

tech,The Force is strong in Battlefront,The warm reception that has greeted Star Wars Battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its backtobasics approach and immense nostalgia quotient Geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of allout gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies Previous Star Wars titles like the acclaimed Knights Of The Old Republic and Jedi Knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchises extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters Battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves The sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive Star Wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for The mayhem can be viewed from either a third or firstperson perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join Darth Vader on the Dark Side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the players personal propensity for good or evil There is ample chance to be a Wookie shoot Ewoks and rush into battle alongside a firedup Luke Skywalker In each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet It really is no more complicated than that Locations include the frozen wastes of Hoth the ice planet from The Empire Strikes Back complete with massive mechanical ATATs on the march There are also the dusty sinister deserts of Tatooine and Geonosis as well as the forest moon of Endor where Return Of The Jedis muchmaligned Ewoks lived The feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic It is worth noting though that on the PlayStation 2 the games graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the Xbox version The pivotal element behind Battlefronts success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of largescale war The number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over Speaking of noise Battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the Star Wars galaxys audio motifs The multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring John Williams symphonies that never let up There is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section It has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being Star Wars it would not stand up for long The gameplay is reliable bogstandard stuff short on originality There are also odd annoyances like the games insistence on respawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear And some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be That said it is still great fun to pilot a Scout Walker or Speeder Bike however non userfriendly they prove Whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind Battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game The aboveaverage AI of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated Battlefronts novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty onetrickpony of a game But for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from George Lucas stable

tech,Gamers could drive highdefinition,TV films and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens It is called highdefinition HD for short and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US It is set according to analysts to do for images what CDs did for sound Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive But Europes gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV To view it it needs to be transmitted in HD format and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the highquality resolution The next generation of consoles however are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005 start of 2006 And most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such highresolution pictures In the next generation of consoles HD support is mandatory Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website Every game is going to be playable in HD So consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs and who have no content to watch are going to be blown away by these really highdetail pictures Its going to change really the way they look at gaming At the end of last year Chris Deering Sonys European president made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008 A previous prediction from analysts Datamonitor put the figure at 46 million by 2008 an increase from an estimated 50000 sets at the end of 2003 But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology about 2000 if there are few programmes or films to watch on them Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of its content in HD by 2010 Until broadcast rights format standards and the practicalities of updating equipment are agreed TV content will be limited All TV images are made up of pixels which go across the screen and scan lines which go down the screen Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels HD offers up to 1080 active lines with each line made up of 1920 pixels This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV Probably in the UK gaming is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off as in look what this TV can do until HD is really adopted by broadcasters explains Dr Tuffy But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics and more immersive gaming experiences They are used to spending money on hardware to match a games requirements Demographics have changed too and the sweet spot for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s This means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of bigscreen highdefinition display technologies and HD projectors earlier than others Higher capacity storage discs such as HDDVD and blueray are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles allowing developers more room for detailed graphics For console developers though HD offers some production changes It could make games production slightly more expensive thinks Dr Tuffy But we may see the crossplatform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console he says You are literally going to get to the point with a Lord of the Rings game for example is going to be closer and closer to the actual film especially the CGI stuff from the DVD And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game just now they have almost got it seamless With HD he says the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the bigscreen cinema release This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide At that point says Dr Tuffy games could become more or less interactive movies

tech,Cyber criminals step up the pace,Socalled phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004 say security experts The number of phishing email messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing email messages Other statistics show that in 2004 73 of all email was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus In its endofyear report MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals In September 2003 MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing emails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related email messages per month Worryingly said the firm phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data Older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake but more recent phishing emails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards Email security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity said Mark Sunner chief technology officer at MessageLabs In just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online he said Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation Already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed indicating a shift from the random scattergun approach to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses he said Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004 viruses and spam remain popular with cybercriminals and vandals One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating To date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation In 2003 only 40 of messages were spam But by the end of 2004 almost threequarters of messages were junk
tech,Savvy searchers fail to spot ads,Internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87 of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine It also shows that few can spot the difference between paidfor results and organic ones The report reveals that 84 of net users say they regularly use Google Ask Jeeves MSN and Yahoo when online Almost 50 of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 19 webpages for each hunt A significant chunk of net users 36 carry out a search at least weekly and 29 of those asked only look every few weeks For 44 of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it According to Pew Research 44 of searchers use just a single search engine 48 use two or three and a small number 7 consult more than three sites Tony Macklin spokesman for Ask Jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes A small number 17 said they wouldnt really miss search engines if they did not exist The remaining 33 said they could not live without search sites More than twothirds of those questioned 68 said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paidfor results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web Of those asked 62 were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search Only 18 of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not Said the Pew report This finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference

tech,How to make a gigapixel picture,The largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the Netherlands The finished image is 25 billion pixels in size making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot If printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution the picture would be 25m high and 6m long The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail The website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200000 visitors every day The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 25 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge The goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003 That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and was made up of 196 separate photographs The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons image He did it all by hand which was an enormous effort and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques it would be feasible to build a larger image said Jurgen den Hartog one of the TNO researchers behind the project We were not competing with Mr Lyons but it started as a lunchtime bet The Dutch team used already available technologies although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the highresolution image We had to rewrite almost all the tools Me den Hartog told the BBC News website All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image so we had to develop one ourselves The 600 component pictures were taken on July 2004 by a computercontrolled camera with a 400 mm lens Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days Following the success of this project and with promises of help from others the TNO team is considering creating a full 360degree panoramic view of another Dutch city with even higher resolution

sport,Mourinho to escape FA charge,Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will not face any Football Association action over the comments he made after their Carling Cup tie with Manchester United Mourinho intimated that United boss Sir Alex Ferguson influenced referee Neale Barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at halftime But an FA spokesman told BBC Sport We are not taking action over Mourinho We have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required That is the end of it Mourinho was concerned that Fergusons conversation with Barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official I see one referee in the first half and another in the second said Mourinho If the FA ask me what happened I will tell them What I saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things Maybe when I turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody I will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit The referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of freekicks It was fault after fault dive after dive But I know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at halftime He should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him but there was also someone else Referees chief Keith Hackett believes Mourinho should retract his comments about Ferguson and Barry as he believes the Blues boss has questioned their integrity Im hoping he might reconsider his comments unfortunately this is the nature of the game said Hackett I dont want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers For the second leg we have an experienced referee and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing Sometimes managers have grounds for comments and I note that but a referees integrity has been questioned that is offensive and should be avoided Mr Mourinho should look at the facts Mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final Its 00 so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time he said We have exactly the same chance we had before this game We are confident of getting a result but we know what Manchester United is a footballing power Itll be difficult for us but also for them

politics,Petrol duties frozen Brown says,Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his prebudget speech to the Commons on Thursday Mr Brown told the House that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments But this financial year because of volatility in the oil market he said the duty would be frozen During 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution He said It is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services But this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market I propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties The RAC welcomed the news calling it an early Christmas present for motorists But the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol Environmental group Transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists We are concerned that although Britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action said a spokesman In 2000 the Peoples Fuel Lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slowmoving convoys after Mr Brown threatened to raise fuel taxes The chancellor did not raise duty that year but despite threats of more protests in 2003 he added 128p per litre
tech,Net fingerprints combat attacks,Eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically The system creates digital fingerprints of ongoing incidents that are sent to every network affected Firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source Data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks Firms signing up for the sensing system include MCI BT Deutsche Telekom Energis NTT Bell Canada and many others The creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by US firm Arbor Networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack Increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites launch worms and relay spam around the net We have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic said Rob Pollard sales director for Arbor Networks which is behind the fingerprinting system Attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination he said Once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem Mr Pollard said Arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected What we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source said Mr Pollard Arbor Networks technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network It spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups Any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a netbased attack of some kind This type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines Anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack Attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated said Malcolm Seagrave security expert at Energis In the last 12 months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and weve seen massive growth He said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks

business,BMW cash to fuel Mini production,Less than four years after the new Mini was launched German car maker BMW has announced 100m of new investment Some 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200000 cars from 2007 The rise from 189000 last year is a response to rapidlyrising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists Before Wednesdays announcement BMW had invested some 280m in Mini production Since its launch during summer 2001 the new Mini has gone from strength to strength Last year almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away said Norbert Reithofer a member of the BMW management board Initially BMW said it would produce 100000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford but the target was quickly reached then raised time and time again Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue The risk is that after theyve invested massively in the brand demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle said Brad Wernle from Automotive News Europe The price of the car has also gone up When it was launched the cheapest Mini cost just more than 10000 These days buyers will have to fork out almost 11500 to own a new Mini One or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to 17730 The Mini Convertible which was launched last spring costs up to 15690 for the top model and there is even a waiting list Secondhand Minis are not cheap either A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least 8000 for the cheapest model while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from 12556 according to thecar buying website Parkers The consumers association Which operates with slightly different numbers yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 16 depreciates slower than any other car other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE The Cowley factory which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100000 Minis is increasingly being put to good use There are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans BMWs Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for 10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium In 1999 when BMW still owned Rover the Oxford factory was producing the awardwinning Rover 75 During that year 3500 people produced 56000 cars Last year in the same factory almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4500 Miniworkers The Mini factorys current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge which in 1999 produced 180000 Rover cars Last year MG Rover which employs more than 6000 people produced just 110000 cars though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation SAIC that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge Indeed Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford are taken into account

politics,Fido to be taken off vote lists,The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote the UK elections watchdog has said Those are some of the mistakes found under the current system where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual identifiers when they vote such as their own voting number date of birth and signature The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll the MPs heard And some people have registered all their family regardless of their age birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check NonBritish citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases Mr Younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes He argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at hard to reach voters for example Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out Mr Younger said using the Royal Mails postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50000 voters He argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form He said it might also help register students in halls of residences where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted Currently British voters have to reregister to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running Mr Younger suggested the reregistration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were uptodate

business,US interest rates increased to 2,US interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months in a widely anticipated move The Federal Reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2 in light of mounting evidence that the US economy is regaining steam US companies created twice as many jobs as expected in October while exports hit record levels in September Analysts said a clearcut victory for President Bush in last weeks election paved the way for a rise Another rise could be in store for December some economists warned The Feds Open Market Committee which sets interest rate policy in the US voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise The Fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer with quarter percentage point rises in June August and September The Central Bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth The Fed did not rule out raising rates once again in December but noted that any future increases would take place at a measured pace In a statement the Fed said that longterm inflation pressures remained well contained while the US economy appeared to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices Financial analysts broadly welcomed the Feds move and shares traded largely flat The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 089 points or 001 at 1038548 Recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the US economy US firms created 337000 jobs last month twice the amount expected while exports reached record levels in September The economy grew 37 in the third quarter slower than forecast but an improvement on the 33 growth seen in the second quarter Analysts claimed the Feds assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in December Lets wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarters energy price drag before concluding that the Fed has more work to do in 2005 said Avery Shenfeld senior economist at CIBC World Markets I think the Federal Reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate said Sung Won Sohn chief US economist for Wells Fargo Bank The economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics employment and the price of oil he added The further rise in US rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on UK monetary policy The Bank of England BoE has kept interest rates on hold at 475 for the past three months leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked In a report published on Wednesday the Bank said that with rates at their current level inflation would rise to its 2 target within two years However BoE governor Mervyn King warned only last month that the era of consistently low inflation and low unemployment may be coming to an end
business,Bank holds interest rate at 475,The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 475 in a widelypredicted move Rates went up five times from November 2003 as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt but have remained unchanged since August Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals And retail sales disappointed over Christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers optimism causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium The BRC said Britains retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade Todays no change decision is correct said David Frost Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce BCC But if there are clear signs that the economy slows the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending Mr Frost added The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain It is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an overabrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the Office for National ONS statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November for the fifth month in the past six The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 01 in November matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists expectations of a 03 rise Manufacturers organisation the EEF said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future It also said there was evidence that manufacturers confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain So far the evidence suggests that last years rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said EEF chief economist Steve Radley However should the business outlook start to deteriorate the Bank should stand ready to cut rates Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5 before that happens The Bank remains concerned about the longterm risks posed by personal debt which is rising at 15 a year if economic conditions worsen

sport,Kuznetsova failed a drugs test,US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug according to Belgian authorities Belgian sports minister Claude Eerdekens said that the Russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on 19 December Kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in Charleroi at the time Eerdekens said There is a problem Ephedrine was discovered She remains innocent until proved guilty She can ask for it to be tested again The situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the World AntiDoping Agency Wada the International Tennis Federation ITF or the Womens Tennis Accosiation WTA The test was carried out by regional Belgian authorities and Kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a B sample tested Speaking at the Australian Open on Monday before Eerdekens identified her Kuznetsova said Im not worried Im not using anything to push myself I have not been notified of any positive test and I think it is unfair that its come out the way it did Eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last Friday to the players address in Spain as well as to the Belgian prosecutors office and the Belgian and Russian tennis federations He conceded Kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance We have simply stated a fact he said It is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence Either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection However Kuznetsovas naming was condemned by Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpishchev First of all this Belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing without any basic evidence Tarpishchev said We all know the basic principle in doping cases If there is a positive sample then they should notify the International Tennis Federation ITF as well as the national federation within three days he said This is not the case here As of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials nor did the ITF Today I called the ITF headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it If WADA the World AntiDoping Agency was behind the testing then we would also have known something by now Otherwise all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts
business,Economy stronger than forecast,The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 04 reported according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax Private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates Ms Lomax said Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth she pointed out This means that despite a strong economic growth base rates will probably stay on hold at 475 Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics ONS Though reliable ONS data takes longer to publish so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value even when preliminary ONS estimates are available Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club The ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate Ms Lomax said The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published but substantially revised upwards years later The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past she said Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee MPC makes the right decisions she said The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2 target A slowdown in the housing market and this years surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky leading to a more uncertain outlook This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s Ms Lomax said The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction Ms Lomax intimated In economic assessment there is safety in numbers

tech,Kenyan school turns to handhelds,At the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus They are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised It is a pilot project run by EduVision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get uptodate information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the nongovernmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called Eslates The Eslates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver The data is transmitted alongside audio signals The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld Eslates It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it It also stores this on its hard disc The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project Its very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but its also a oneway connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult The project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linuxbased system The content is divided into visual information textual information and questions Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the worlds largest university libraries All books in the public domain something like 15 million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the Eslates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working Maciej Sundra who designed the user interface for the Eslates says the projects ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks The fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting as they need it most

business,BBC poll indicates economic gloom,Citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a BBC World Service poll believe the world economy is worsening Most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse But when asked about their own familys financial outlook a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future Almost 23000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster The poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving Those surveyed in three countries were split In percentage terms an average of 44 of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse compared to 34 who said it was improving Similarly 48 were pessimistic about their national economy while 41 were optimistic And 47 saw their familys economic conditions improving as against 36 who said they were getting worse The poll of 22953 people was conducted by the international polling firm GlobeScan together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes Pipa at the University of Maryland While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago people seem to not have fully absorbed this development though they are personally experiencing its effects said Pipa director Steven Kull People around the world are saying Im OK but the world isnt There may be a perception that war terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance says the BBCs Elizabeth Blunt The countries where people were most optimistic both for the world and for their own families were two fastgrowing developing economies China and India followed by Indonesia China has seen two decades of blistering economic growth which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale says the BBCs Louisa Lim in Beijing But the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their countrys rosy economic future our correspondent says South Korea was the most pessimistic while respondents in Italy and Mexico were also quite gloomy The BBCs David Willey in Rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001 which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents families but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy Pipa conducted the poll from 15 November 2004 to 3 January 2005 across 22 countries in facetoface or telephone interviews The interviews took place between 15 November 2004 and 5 January 2005 The margin of error is between 25 and 4 points depending on the country In eight of the countries the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas
tech,Mobile networks seek turbo boost,Thirdgeneration mobile 3G networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week Fast 3G networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association At 3GSM Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks The system is not available commercially yet but Motorola the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA High Speed Downlink Packet Access a highspeed high bandwidth technology available now Early HSDPA systems typically offer around two megabits per second Mbps compared with less than 384 kilobits per second Kbps on standard 3G networks HighSpeed Downlink Packet Access HSDPA sometimes called Super 3G will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by UKbased research consultancy Analysys A number of companies are developing the technology Nokia and Canadabased wireless communication products company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on High Speed Downlink Packet Access The two companies aim to jointly market the HSDPA solution to global network operator customers While HSDPA theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14Mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in widearea networks said Dr Alastair Brydon author of the Analysys report Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic WCDMA 3G he added Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 29Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution Data Optimised EVDO US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3G network at the end of last year We are expanding our network and deploying EVDO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said Oliver Valente Sprints vice president for technology development when the contract was announced As part of 3bn in multiyear contracts announced late last year Sprint will spend around 1bn on EVDO technology from Lucent Technologies Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speeds of 0305 megabits a second and peak download rates of 24Mbps MMO2 the UKbased operator with services in the UK Ireland and Germany has opted for technology based on HSDPA Using technology from Lucent it will offer data speeds of 36Mbps from next summer on its Isle of Man 3G network and will eventually support speeds of up to 144Mbps US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting HSDPA using technology from Lucent alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson Siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but Christoph Caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015 the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10 Siemens in collaboration with the Fraunhofer GermanSino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one This enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band The speeds offered by 3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3G licences But today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dialup phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 05 megabits a second much faster than 3G This means users are likely to find 3G disappointing unless the networks are souped up If they arent those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately Siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multipleantennae devices and conduct field trials A commercial system could be as far away as 2012 though Siemens did not rule out an earlier date

tech,Court mulls filesharing future,Judges at the US Supreme Court have been hearing evidence for and against filesharing networks The court will decide whether producers of filesharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement They questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue filesharers could deter innovation They also said that filetrading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy The lawsuit brought by 28 of the worlds largest entertainment firms has raged for several years Legal experts agree that if the Supreme Court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue filetrading firms into bankruptcy But if the judge rules that Grokster and Morpheus the filesharers at the centre of the case are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of filesharing providers Instead they would have to pursue individuals who use peertopeer networks to get their hands on free music and movies The hitech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue Intel filed a document with the Supreme Court earlier this month in defence of Grokster and others despite misgivings about some aspects of the filesharing community It summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products are essentially tools that like any other tools capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes Asking firms to secondguess the uses that its technologies would be put to and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use would stifle innovation it said The Electronic Frontier Foundation a civil rights watchdog is also defending StreamCast Networks the company behind the Morpheus filesharing software The case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation it said It cites as do many the landmark ruling in 1984 which found that Sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its Betamax video recorder could be used for piracy Defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peertopeer networks upholding the precedent set by the Sony Betamax case A small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered wearing Save Betamax tshirts The Betamax principles stand as the Magna Carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the US over the past 20 years said Gary Shapiro chief executive of the Consumer Electronics Association Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said that inventions from printing to Apples iPod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had on balance been beneficial to society He said that while filetrading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music conceptually the technology had some really excellent uses Based on Tuesdays hearing it seems unlikely that the Betamax ruling will be overturned but filesharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy Groksters lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up But this argument was dismissed as ridiculous by Justice David Souter CEA boss Mr Shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the Supreme Court will hear this year Its about preserving Americas proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology he said The case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peertopeer networks They ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs filesharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software government documents and promotional copies of music

tech,Robotic pods take on car design,A new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota The companys vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a fourwheeled leaflike device or strolling along encased in an eggshaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet Both these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi Japan in March 2005 The models are being positioned as socalled personal mobility devices which have few limits The open leaflike iunit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year Built using environmentally friendly plantbased materials the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes The model allows the user to make tight onthespot turns move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music Also on display at the show will be the eggshaped ifoot This is a twolegged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick Standing at a height of well over seven feet 21 metres the unit can walk along at a speed of about 135kmh 083mph and navigate staircases into the bargain Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the birdlike legs that bend over backwards They are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University They clearly have eyecatching appeal which is in part the name of the game here and are linked to the iMac and iPodtype niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years new different hitech image conscious products As always with these concept vehicles it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace The personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities Toyotas prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individuals particular mobility needs While Toyotas prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility Experts though are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area Those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance now and certainly in the future are the elderly and infirm people Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups Design considerations also exist Dr Erel Avineri of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled For example one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need This and other humanfactors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered said Dr Avineri In general introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle Such singleperson vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions said Dr Gillingwater Whats their range How userfriendly will they really be What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions

tech,Fileswappers ready new network,Legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down One site behind the success of the BitTorrent fileswapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised That filesharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnovaorg which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to Now the man behind suprnovaorg who goes by the nickname Sloncek is preparing to release software for a new fileswapping network dubbed Exeem In an interview with Novastream web radio Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa filesharing systems Like BitTorrent Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone There will be no centrally maintained list This said Sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users An early public version of the software should be available before February Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program Despite Suprnova administrator Slonceks involvement with Exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files Sloncek told Novastream Dr Johan Pouwelse a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peertopeer networks said Exeem was the next evolution in filesharing systems But he said it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared Exeem cannot prevent pollution he said The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one thats full of crap like Kazaa he said There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of filesharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading When big files were being shared moderation systems were key said Mr Pouwelse He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic Its hard to compete with free he said Noone from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the filesharing development

tech,Mobiles get set for visual radio,The growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked Games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but 2005 could see another big innovation that wont just see a change in our mobile phone habits it might alter the way we listen to the radio Finnish handset giant Nokia has been working on a technology called Visual Radio which takes an existing FM signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures It is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested the early days of DAB Digital Radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day One problem is that the name Visual Radio leads people to think of television but Reidar Wasenius a senior project manager at Nokia was adamant that Visual Radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium He said Im very happy to say its not television what were talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today If you have a Visual Radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you dont know or theres a competition or vote that youd like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the onair broadcast youve just been listening to That visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to As well as details on the track or artist of a particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in a similar way to digital televisions red button content Possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing But the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a realtime basis This in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners As the Visual Radio content is transmitted by existing GPRS technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network And there will be a cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage If you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact itll be two or three pounds per month said Mr Wasenius But typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month The payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dialup connections One thing that is for sure assuming that Nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be 100 million Visual Radioenabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006 Basically Visual Radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before The first Visual Radio service in the UK will begin in a few months time with Virgin Radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners Station manager Steve Taylor commented Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way Not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets Initially Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handsets due out soon the 3230 and 7710 but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them Listen again to the interview on the Radio Five Live website

tech,Mobile multimedia slow to catch on,There is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular Consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26 increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004 according to analysts Gartner More than 167 million handsets were sold globally between July and September 2004 a period that according to Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi is seldom strong But although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so In fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that 36 of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message MMS up from 7 in 2003 This is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the UK more than doubled to 75 million Getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying The problem they face said Shailendra Jain head of MMS firm Adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets Also he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it Research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to According to Continental Research 29 of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation Only 11 regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to peoples reluctance to start sending them said Mr Jain They ask themselves If Im streaming video from one handset to another will it work he said Theres a lot of user apprehension about that There are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might Andrew Bud executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system The rate we can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant he said The reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users Noone wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of MMS messages is capped said Mr Bud This has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as Wappush to get multimedia to their customers But when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic Israeli technology firm Celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth One of the first firms to use the Celltick service is Hutch India the largest mobile firm in the country The broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems While not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content As a result 40 of the subscribers to the Hutch Alive which uses Cellticks broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator Operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said Yaron Toren spokesman for Celltick Until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting through

politics,Labour battle plan hides Blair,The Tories have accused Tony Blair of being terrified of scrutiny after Labour unveiled details of how it will fight the next general election In a break with tradition the party will ditch the leaders battle bus and daily press briefings in Westminster Instead Mr Blair will travel to key cities and marginal seats to deliver the partys message Labour election chief Alan Milburn denied the party was trying to hide the prime minister He promised the most positive and upbeat election campaign Labour has ever run But Tory cochairman Liam Fox said Labours plans showed Mr Blair was terrified of facing proper scrutiny At a time when the British people are looking for more accountability and openness this government turns its back on them abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference it does rather beg the question What have they got to hide The general election is widely expected next May and all the parties are stepping up their campaign preparations Mr Milburn said the economy would take centre stage in Labours campaign in what would be a watershed election and the last stand of the Thatcherites Mr Milburn said Labours slogan would be Britain is working Dont let the Tories wreck it The tone of the campaign said Mr Milburn would be more conversational than rhetorical more spontaneous less scripted less national more local and less based on issues and more concentrated on people The approach is particularly designed to appeal to women voters he said Mr Milburn brushed aside questions over why the chancellor was not present at the Cabinet meeting to discuss election strategy particularly since such importance was being given to the economy Im not privy to everybodys diary he said Mr Brown has headed Labours preparations for previous polls but Mr Milburn is taking that role this time In a break with the past Labour will not hold a daily news conference in London It will not be a battle bus style campaign either he said In previous elections each party leader has had their own battle bus transporting national newspaper television and radio reporters to staged campaign events around the country Mr Milburn said Labours media effort this time would focus more on local newspapers and broadcasters with every local radio station given the chance to interview the prime minister Mr Milburn said there would also be a greater effort to set up facetoface meetings between ministers and the electorate Former Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell is also returning to advise Labour on media strategy and campaigning Mr Milburn said no decision had been taken yet over whether David Blunkett would have a prominent role in the election Liberal Democrat chief executive Lord Rennard suggested Labour was avoiding news conferences in London because it wanted less scrutiny of its record and proposals Tony Blair seems to have disappeared from Labour leaflets and broadcasts he said In contrast Charles Kennedy will feature prominently in the Liberal Democrat campaign right across the country
politics,Lawyer attacks antiterror laws,A senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the governments antiterror laws says the current system is giving Britain a bad name Ian MacDonald QC quit when the government failed to recognise a House of Lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful He was part of a 19strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists Five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign Mr MacDonald told BBC News The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally Under the AntiTerrorism Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial But Mr MacDonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury My own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury a proper criminal trial with proper accusations As far as Im concerned the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this he added The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday According to the Independent his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers Nicholas Blake QC Andrew Nicol QC Manjit Singh Gill QC Rick Scannell and Tom de la Mare They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission SIAC a secure court without a jury which tries terror suspects Mr MacDonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow But Barry Hugill a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty told Radio 4s Today programme that more lawyers may go I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning he said They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in the right to trial by jury has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights Helena Kennedy a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer said the Special Advocates main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review she said Without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot as Ian McDonald has said on our legal landscape something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law

tech,Digital guru floats sub100 PC,Nicholas Negroponte chairman and founder of MITs Media Labs says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than 100 53 He told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries He said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood He said the child could use the laptop like a text book He described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a Linuxbased operating system We have to get the display down to below 20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel The second trick is to get rid of the fat if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on While the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken However Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops We put in 25 laptops three years ago only one has been broken the kids cherish these things its also a TV a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim were going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but were not talking about doing it in three or five years were talking about months He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order In China they spend 17 per child per year on textbooks Thats for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away
business,Golden rule intact says exaide,Chancellor Gordon Brown will meet his golden economic rule with a margin to spare according to his former chief economic adviser Formerly one of Mr Browns closest Treasury aides Ed Balls hinted at a Budget giveaway on 16 March He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules Any rate rise ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Partys chances of winning he added Last July Mr Balls won the right to step down from his Treasury position and run for parliament defending the Labour stronghold of Normanton in West Yorkshire Mr Balls rejected the allegation that Mr Brown had been sidelined in the election campaign saying he was playing a different role to the one he played in the last two elections He rejected speculation that Mr Brown was considering becoming Foreign Secretary saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development Gordon Browns decision to announce the date of the Budget while on a trip to China was a sensible thing to do since he was talking about skills and investment at the time Mr Balls told the BBC Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee MPC to factor a potential election into its rate decisions Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising Consumer borrowing rose at a nearrecord pace in January I dont believe it would be a big election issue in Britain or a problem for Labour Mr Balls said Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election but most pundits are betting on 5 May as the likely day
tech,A question of trust and technology,A major government department is without email for a week and technology analyst Bill Thompson wants to know what happened A couple of weeks ago I wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days It seems that thousands of civil servants at the UKs Department of Work and Pensions went through the same thing last week It has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way depriving staff of email and access to the application software they use to calculate peoples benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances Senior consultants from EDS the computer firm which manage the system and Microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done Fortunately the backoffice systems which actually pay people their money were still working so only new claims and updates were affected done properly This is bad enough for those affected but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners I am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans Although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from Windows 2000 to Windows XP went wrong and XP code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network This is certainly unfortunate but I have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved Todays computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile The interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems It is the network equivalent of Godels Theorem any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically So I will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck What is really disturbing and cannot be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press It is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on BBC Radio 4s Today programme throughout Friday morning So why did not the prime ministers official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before Friday Why was not the pensions minister in Parliament to make an emergency statement on Tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problem If there had been an outbreak of Legionnaires disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment While EDS and Microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too And the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand That means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it It would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege A major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently Anything less is a betrayal of public trust Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital

politics,Brown outlines third term vision,Gordon Brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of New Labours next general election bid He said ensuring every child in Britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the NHSs creation The chancellor has previously planned the partys election strategy but this time the role will be filled by Alan Milburn a key ally of Tony Blair The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labours campaign and praised his handling of the economy Writing in the Guardian newspaper Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear Labours ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment not just attacking ignorance disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education good health and sustainable communities BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Browns article was a warning shot to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process It was as always coded and careful but entirely deliberate was Mr Marrs assessment The prime minister was asked about Mr Browns article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4s Today programme Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellors role would be central Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of Mr Browns management of the economy And he pledged childcare would be a centrepiece of Labours manifesto He also predicted the next general election will be a tough tough fight for New Labour But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May Mr Blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labours majority instead of hoping for an outright win
tech,Media gadgets get moving,Pocketsized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005 according to industry experts Last year saw the emergence of portable media players such as the Windowsbased Creative Zen portable media player the Samsung Yepp the iRiver PMC100 and the Archos AV400 series among others But this year they are set to get smarter and more connected to allow people to find more video to watch on them Archos launched its latest range of its Linuxbased portable media devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Friday Dubbed the Pocket Media Assistant PMA430 it crucially has wifi capability builtin for the first time Consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access said Henri Crohas chief of Archos And now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time Archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in peoples pockets after the mobile Unlike Windowsbased players the Archos AV400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source such as TVs as well as playback The content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device Recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it And wifi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a highspeed wireless link Archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to Linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device Microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at CES primarily for US consumers though It has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company TiVo which Bill Gates also showcased in his keynote speech at CES The TiVo To Go service means that US consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their TiVos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the Windowsbased portable media players or smartphones It also said it had launched a service with MTV to let people watch Comedy Central VH1 and Country Music TV on its devices And a service is launching with MSN to provide people with shortened versions of news entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the PC onto the portable devices But the ability to record directly from TV VCR and digital cable and satellite boxes which Windowsbased devices do not offer certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too The increased capability of these devices and the content deals that are being done may go some way to persuading people to use them Recent research by Jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music Only 13 of Europeans wanted to watch video while on the move More seemed interested in spending their cash on musiconly devices This year we are ready for an explosion of portable media Microsofts Mike Coleman told the BBC News website We are very bullish about it The fact that I can put photos on here too and share them is supercool to the consumer he added The fact that Europeans are far larger public transport users than Americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too There is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work Although Microsofts content distribution deals are for the US market at the moment talks were always ongoing with European content suppliers to offer similar services Various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however But that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices particularly via those which are wifi enabled The possibility is open for nonprofessional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work CES which runs from 6 to 9 January showcases more than 50000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005

entertainment,Brits debate over urban music,Joss Stone a 17yearold soul singer from Devon beat Dizzee Rascal Jamelia Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards Her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is Im not really comfortable with the word urban Its a word thats been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong How far are the Brits removed from innercity music and what people are doing Its so far removed that I dont expect them to get it bang on The music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway People dont feel like thats anything to do with us I dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by Joss Stone winning or her being nominated or by the Brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day Its not really relevant If Joss Stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it Its got nothing to do with whats really going on Urban as a genre is very broad If you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hiphop RB garage and into that obviously comes soul Joss Stone is a soul artist Her first album was called The Soul Sessions So urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of subgenres and there are offshoots of all of those Joss Stone has had amazing success in the US given that shes a UK artist What has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a 17yearold from Devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good I think thats whats done it The award for best British urban act was voted for by viewers of MTV Base I dont think Joss was not a worthy winner She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban The fact that shes from Devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural The great thing about urban music is that theres a big range If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain I think thats where you can call it urban thats where this new subcategory or ubercategory has come from Joss Stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine It has to come across as real Thats the only cutoff point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge people What urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background Music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multicultural Britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too Race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included Out of all the awards dished out yesterday Im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award A type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life She might not be urban but when did RB become the hip hop tainted thing it is now RB stands for Rhythm And Blues remember That Joss Stone is rubbish is certain If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music I think probably should include HipHop Soul Funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the Streets although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim She definitely deserved to win a prize Joss Stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year This whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win I cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she is She did deserve it but I agree with the comments about urban music Its a stupid phrase and particularly British In the states they tend to use hip hop and RB if I say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what Im talking about Very strange Whats in a name A rose by any other name etc If people want to call it urban why not If we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance to Whilst I agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won Urban to me is what I hear being played in parties in the inner cities I live in Brixton and have never heard The Soul Sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties Ive been to Good luck to Joss Stone lets celebrate her victory lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as Jamelia Lemar Kanye West Dizzee Rascal Alicia Keys and Outkast we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an award So what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black And if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it Shes 17 has an amazing voice and won Good on her Oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then How dare she Though hang on didnt the socalled public vote on this one This idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what Jazz was The media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling Jazz much to the chagrin of the artists It would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time Jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term And so what of Urban music In truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand Soul and garage are worlds apart musically Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam but no doubt have their connections If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents I demand a prize for rural music Sucks to the cities its way better out here We have hay for one thing Excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely I dont understand the point that Ty is making If Lemar who makes music which is less soulful than Joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black too How can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the Devon countryside Nonsense I love Joss to bits and dont care what her branding is its amazing music full stop Stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour Surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the USA could sing country music If that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style The term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards The very term Music of Black Origin has confused and offended many people This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards It appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable The term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind The result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means Perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soulRnB and HipHop one which does not also mean something else as we have done with Crunk Urban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now The word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago Its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it Im in a band that has been called urban and I despise the label Id hate to think I belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity Look at all the TV broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music Ignore the labels it is what it is just music As a black man I think I agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives Black people should lead the music they invented We should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black Same thing with Streets Amy Winehouse etc Whos ever heard of Terri Walker or Rhian Benson They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos but why not Brits So what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards Her music is great soul and surely that is under the Urban banner What if The Streets had won Would people be whining because Mike Skinner is white It seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else Urban is PC version for saying black music Im not doubting Ms Stones talent but why didnt Jamelia or Lemar get a Brit This reminds me of what happened to Craig David and Soul II Soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a Brit seems to be the hardest thing Refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days More power to you people You have said it there is music you like and music you dont like who cares what label you put on it That entire category was a mess How can you have people like Dizzee Rascal up against Joss Stone Its like putting Eminem against Bob Geldof She should have been nominated for Best British R B act Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents but I dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams Urban is a nonsense term music of black origin Well doesnt that include rock Music made in the inner cities Well almost all bands end up making music in LondonManchester etc And doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities It doesnt make any sense Why does music have to be put into a genre Its music you like it or you dont Simple as that I play in a heavy metal band We are urban music as far as Im concerned We live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment It therefore directly shapes what we write musically Urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music Why it needed a rebrand I dont know as the name is misleading Oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as such Joss Stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the Brit All this urban and other such categorisation is just the redtape of the music business and is best ignored Yeah she deserved it She is talented Urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though Theres only two kinds of music good and bad

tech,PC photo printers challenge pros,Home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from High Street developers tests shows A survey carried out by PC Pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab The tests found that images from top PC printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs But using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months warned the magazine The group test of 100 home photo printers for PCs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as High Street names such as Jessops Boots and Snappy Snaps The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage It found that although some ink for printers now costs more than 2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a High Street store If you really like your photos then its definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street but only if you choose the right printer said Nick Ross top tester at PC Pro Mr Ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many High Street developers or even some professional wedding photographers Some High Street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in said Mr Ross but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home According to PC Pro producing a print 8x10in on an Epson R800 printer using top quality paper costs 187 At Jessops the same image would cost 250 and at Snappy Snaps 999 A 10x7in snap at Boots would cost 499 Considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the High Street and how silverhalide prints can fade in the sun were adamant that its now better cheaper and more convenient to print at home he said Ann Simpson marketing manager at Snappy Snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one she said Many people are not skilled at getting the colour contrast and cropping right and they dont want the hassle she added The magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading It recommended avoiding socalled thirdparty inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest

business,China suspends 26 power projects,China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations including two at the Three Gorges Dam on environmental grounds The move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact they are typical illegal projects of construction first approval next said SEPA vicedirector Pan Yue in a statement on the agencys website Some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits but others would be cancelled he said Altogether the agency ordered 30 projects halted Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants with some extensions to existing ones The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central governments battle to control projects licensed by local officials However previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity such as steel and cement The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto parttime working last year In 2004 China increased its generating capacity by 126 or 440700 megawatts MW The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project designed to produce 12600 MW of electricity It is being built on the Jinshajiang or river of golden sand as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known Second and third on the agencys list were two power stations being built at the 22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze an underground 4200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it and abroad It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China In April 2004 central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River which is part of a United Nations world heritage site the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze Mekong and Nu also known as the Salween according to the UKpublished China Review That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists Chinas energy shortage influenced global prices for oil coal and shipping last year

politics,EU rules wont stop UK spending,The shape of the UKs economy In graphics But he denied that he was ruling out British membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure science and education in the future Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China he told MPs The chancellor said that the EUs planned changes in the growth and stability pact designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1 over the economic cycle Under Mr Browns rules the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year to include investment and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year Under Mr Browns sustainable investment rule government debt should be under 40 in contrast to the 60 allowed under the growth and stability pact Mr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules In March the Office of National Statistics ONS reclassified 34bn of spending on road repairs as public investment shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only 6bn Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was impugning the integrity of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers Earlier exConservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone Speaking on Radio 4s Today programme Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more rigid rules But fellow Tory David HeathcoatAmory said the folly of the system was in trying to run Europes varied economies on one set of rules The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake he said The warning is about the European constitution which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution It gives more powers to Brussels to coordinate things like employment and economic policy But speaking to the Treasury Select Committee Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future potentially opening the way for future euro membership The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact Mr Brown said

tech,Blinx sequel purrs nicely,The original Blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to Microsofts then new Xbox console Its sharp graphics and novel gameplay with the main character able to pause slow rewind and fastforward time were meant to lure many fans to the new machine But poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded halfway through a level without the required tools to finish Thankfully the sequel has fixed many of the original faults This time around you do not play as Blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters The character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game As the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions pig and feline assuming the role of your created characters The thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing Time Crystal As in the original your feline persona can control time but this time the pigs get to control space There are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps space bubbles and void traps in order to progress The control over space and time is achieved through a number of VCRstyle icons and is quite intuitive Annoyingly the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them The game has also tried to emulate franchises such as Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank on PS2 and so there are a number of combat elements These are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair But the games excellent graphics easily the bestlooking platform game around sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans Blinx 2 is out on Xbox now

tech,Nintendo DS aims to touch gamers,The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of highprofile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback Market leader Nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks Far from looking like a mouldbreaking handheld it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype The lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree Both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firms preeminence in an increasinglycompetitive mobile gaming market Nintendo first launched its GameBoy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since But its lead can no longer be taken for granted Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable while startup companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices We believe the DS will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said David Yarnton Nintendo Europes general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld With its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points It went on sale in the US in midNovember priced 150 and Nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device With more than two million preorders for the device in Japan Nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed The game ships with a demo of Metroid Hunters a 3D action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machines wireless capabilities It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people The game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a topdown map and the ability to switch weapons It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating Super Mario 64 DS is a faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 classic with a host of new minigames and new levels The game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine One thing is for certain Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers If they manage to create titles which use the Nintendo DSs key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up The fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks
tech,Be careful how you code,A new European directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson If it gets its way the Dutch government will conclude its presidency of the European Union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the European Parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of European citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them If the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our TV screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives Sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs a topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess Middle Britain After all how much fuss can you generate about the Directive on the Patentability of ComputerImplemented Inventions and the way it amends Article 52 of the 1973 European Patent Convention Yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the EUs ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in Europe just as they are in the US Many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement It will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas In the US you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to reenter them unless Amazon lets you because they hold the patent on oneclick online purchase It is a small invention but Amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it We are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long The new proposals go back to 2002 although argument about patentability of software and computerimplemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid1980s They have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made endorsed by the Council of Ministers radically modified by the European Parliament and then represented in their original form Some national governments seem to be aware of the problems Poland has rejected the proposal and Germanys main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection Early in December the British government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals Science Minister Lord Sainsbury went along to listen and outline the UK position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned The draft Directive is being put through the council as what is called an A item and can only be approved or rejected No discussion or amendment is allowed So why should we be worried First there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments This goes to the heart of the European project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried If coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow More directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone elses patent This is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright Patents are not copyright but something much stronger A patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately I have never to my shame managed to read Lord Byrons Childe Harolds Pilgrimage If it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then I could defend myself in court by claiming that I had simply made it up and it was coincidence The same does not hold for a patent If I sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the LZW algorithm used in GIF files then I am in trouble under patent law at least in the US Coincidence is no defence The proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are USbased and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents They have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or crosslicense with other patent holders Even this system breaks down of course as Microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by Eolas which claimed that Internet Explorer and other browsers infringed an Eolas patent That one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars But small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade Much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the Apache web server the GNULinux operating system and the fearsomely popular Firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements The damage to software will not happen overnight of course If the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products Eventually someone will decide to attack Linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players The new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas And it will damage Europes computer industry We can only hope that the Council of Ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital

politics,Choose hope over fear Kennedy,Voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election said Charles Kennedy In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and populist scares He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll On the Asian tsunami he said it had been very heartening to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons Mr Kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties The general election would be a threeparty struggle as the Conservative party fades away as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands he said A clear division is emerging in British politics the politics of fear versus the politics of hope Labour is counting on the politics of fear ratcheting up talk of threats crime and insecurity While the Conservatives are reworking their populist scares about asylum and the European menace he said He said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties It was already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights he said He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials curbing of rights to protest increased stop and search powers and ID card plans He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination But at the same time an overmighty state is a dangerous one he said His party instinctively understood the new liberal Britain which is no longer a nation with one family structure and one colour he said We are less deferential more inclined to think for ourselves more open about sexuality and equality Our national institutions are changing too We are no longer a nation of one church we are a nation of many faiths In our attitudes and the way we live our lives this is in many ways a liberal Britain

business,US trade gap hits record in 2004,The gap between US exports and imports hit an alltime high of 6717bn 484bn in 2004 latest figures show The Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 244 above the previous record 2003s imbalance of 4965bn The deficit with China up 305 at 162bn was the largest ever recorded with a single country However on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 49 in December to 564bn The US consumers appetite for all things from oil to imported cars and even wine and cheese reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bushs economic policies Democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices For example they believe Chinas currency policy which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40 has given Chinas rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors Meanwhile the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world spurring on more demand for imported goods Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollardenominated assets which may in turn harm growth For all of 2004 US exports rose 123 to 115 trillion but imports rose even faster by 163 to a new record of 176 trillion Foreign oil exports surged by 357 to a record 1807bn reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand Imports were not affected by the dollars weakness last year We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend said economist MariePierre Ripert at IXIS
tech,Savvy searchers fail to spot ads,Internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87 of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine It also shows that few can spot the difference between paidfor results and organic ones The report reveals that 84 of net users say they regularly use Google Ask Jeeves MSN and Yahoo when online Almost 50 of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 19 webpages for each hunt A significant chunk of net users 36 carry out a search at least weekly and 29 of those asked only look every few weeks For 44 of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it According to Pew Research 44 of searchers use just a single search engine 48 use two or three and a small number 7 consult more than three sites Tony Macklin spokesman for Ask Jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes A small number 17 said they wouldnt really miss search engines if they did not exist The remaining 33 said they could not live without search sites More than twothirds of those questioned 68 said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paidfor results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web Of those asked 62 were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search Only 18 of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not Said the Pew report This finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference

sport,Record fails to lift lacklustre meet,Yelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham And hey there are not many meets that go by without the Russian breaking a world record Apparently Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and I would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition Mind you every time she breaks the record she gets 30000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it World records aside I thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for Kelly Holmes She looked good and was very positive Agnes Samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three 800m runners this season Yes Samaria let Kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so On the other hand I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens 60m in Madrid He started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish It would have been nice to see what Mark LewisFrancis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified He was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly My view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again Having said that Mark is looking in much better shape But I havent seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests Frances Ronald Pognon who has run 645 seconds will be under threat at the Europeans From a British point of view Sarah Claxtons victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet Something else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the womens national 400m race in a new personal best of 5298 seconds AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships Scotlands Lee McConnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal From an international perspective I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3000m but I dont think the pacemaking was great Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last years shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money She had a go but just could not hang in there We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the mens 1500m But he has only just come over from the USA so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape As for Kenenisa Bekele he was well beaten by Markos Geneti But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly

tech,Broadband soars in 2004,If broadband were a jumbo jet then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway firing up its engines and preparing for takeoff But this year has seen it soar In the spring it literally took to the skies as Lufthansa and British Airways trialled it on flights This perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology rather than how useful skyhigh broadband would actually be It was flying high and by the autumn five million Britons had signed up for highspeed net access at home Such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million or more than 30 of homes The two key factors in whetting peoples appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push When operators such as BT and Telewest offered standard 512K broadband for less than 20 at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached broadband had truly gone mass market A feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market takeup of dialup Broadband for less than 10 was even touted by some firms although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models For those who became broadbanders in 2004 there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities The rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access to the tune of 100 million connections worldwide by April prompting research firm Point Topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever By September the number of broadband connections in the UK finally overtook dialup and in December BT announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds Broadband was being mentioned on the 10 Oclock News and in the tabloids the Sun even carried a cartoon joke about it But two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines In May BT quietly announced that it was shaving 70 off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges socalled local loop unbundling The vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes At the moment BT has a stranglehold on more than 80 of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what ADSL products get into homes With cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to BT can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoiselike It will mean the UK will finally catch up with countries such as France and the Netherlands where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15Mb megabits per second And the major price fall means that rather than just talk about it companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into BTs exchanges It may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the Northern Ireland peace talks fraught bitter and with no end in sight Another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of BTs reach meaning more than 95 of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived There was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1Mbps broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadbandenabled exchange For thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology the news meant they could finally join in Broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators NTL and Telewest also had a bumper year The biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing 2Mb and 3Mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512K The cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route Broadband can seem confusing for consumers with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and setup fees It is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching As it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride
business,Arsenal may seek full share listing,Arsenal vicechairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange Speaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai he said a full listing was one of the options for funding after the club moves to its new stadium The club which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange is due to move into its new 60000seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 200607 season Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season When Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52 this season to 34 in two years time The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29 to 40 of turnover and has not ruled out other moneyearning means including a full share listing When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review Mr Dein said Listing would be one option but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet We want to be in the best financial health maybe clubs can do it listing Manchester United have been a success Mr Dein said that although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years he feared there might now be too many games being shown Since the formation of the Premier League in season 199293 Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the worlds leading league competition We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too I think we have practically reached saturation point sometimes I think less is more The club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources including debt from banks from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors and from the sale of surplus property including its Highbury Stadium It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets including Asia We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too as they are around the world We have got a very good product so it is very important we go and look at these markets and make sure we are on the case

business,Golden economic period to end,Ten years of golden economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly City consultancy Deloitte has warned The UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2 this year below Chancellor Gordon Browns forecast of 3 to 35 It also believes that interest rates will fall to 4 by the end of the year In its quarterly economic review Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a golden period during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s But it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major imbalances in the economy Deloittes chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes Deloitte believes Gordon Brown will need to raise about 10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term the firm claims This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year when the economy expanded by 325 However Deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering It expects a series of aggressive interest rate cuts over the next two years with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 475 mark to 35 by the end of 2006 Although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the UK economy Mr Bootle

sport,Healey targets England comeback,Leicester wing Austin Healey hopes to use Sundays return Heineken Cup clash with Wasps as a further springboard to an England recall for the Six Nations Healey who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 World Cup has been in good form in the Tigers resurgence this season I definitely still have ambitions to play for England Healey told the BBC We will have to see what happens after the previous autumn Tests but when I look at the current squad I definitely feel there is a place there for me Healey who has also played both halfback positions and fullback during his career has reverted to the wing where he won most of his England caps After recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of September the 31yearold is relishing his role in the Tigers revival I had six weeks out but fortunately I have resumed the sort of form I had before he said I am basically playing where it best suits Leicester Obviously I can play scrumhalf flyhalf or fullback at a moments notice But playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where I am not expected and influence things That has been apparent in parts one and two of the WaspsLeicester trilogy in recent weeks First Healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injurytime try that earned the Tigers a 1717 draw in their Premiership meeting on 21 November Then in the first of their Heineken cup double header last Sunday Healey slotted in at standoff and delivered a superb crosskick for Martin Corry to score the Tigers third try I caught Cozzas eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score Healey recalled Healey twice a Heineken Cup winner believes last Sundays match was up there with some of the biggest club contests he has played in It was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game he recalled There was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in After about 15 minutes I thought we might stride away with it but Wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way The same outcome this Sunday would put Leicester in pole position to top their Heineken pool with a home game against Biarritz and away trip to Calvisano to come But Healey insists the Tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed rugbys version of Rocky II There was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done he added It was the first of a twoleg trip and if we lose at Welford Road it will negate all the positives we can take from result I think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end I think we did We have got to show the same desire again this week
politics,Lib Dems bold election policy,Charles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election With the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes Mr Kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation It is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the Lib Dems and the other two With his partys previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government he has switched tack Now he is promising to levy a modest increase of the same amount on earnings over 100000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges They are to scrap student fees finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax That last policy will also see about 3 of the most well off paying more while others pensioners in particular will pay less Labour and the Tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed Inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services The Tories claim they can improve services AND cut taxes through 35bn efficiency savings while Labour has offered 22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases In many ways the argument between the Lib Dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between Labour and the Tories in the 1980s and early 1990s But unlike the old ToryLabour debate he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services That is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking Michael Howards proposals for quotas Once again with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration Mr Kennedy is stressing the different more liberal approach of his party Mr Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his partys election chances declaring the Tories were not going to be significant players in the poll He repeated his pledge not to do postelection deals with either party after the election Mr Kennedy went on to suggest the reelection of a Labour government with a small majority would amount to a massive vote of no confidence in Tony Blairs government That suggests the Lib Dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful even pivotal position in a vastly different House of Commons after the next election It is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before

tech,Speech takes on search engines,A Scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results Called Speegle it has the look and feel of a normal search engine with the added feature of being able to read out the results Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November But experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments The Edinburghbased firm CEC has married speech technology with everpopular internet search The ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web According to search engine Ask Jeeves around 80 of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net People visiting Speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the BBC and Reuters It is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad said Speegle founder Gordon Renton The system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people although the Royal National Institute of the Blind RNIB is looking at the technology he added But Julie Howell digital policy manager at the RNIB expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind peoples experience of the web There are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be she said Blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way she added The site uses a technology dubbed PanaVox which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech In the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but CEC says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dialup connections Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known if silent search engine Google Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments said Mr Renton It is not a ripoff We are doing something that Google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery he said Speegle is proving popular with those learning English in countries such as Japan and China The site is bombarded by people just listening to the words The repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots said Mr Renton

tech,Looks and music to drive mobiles,Mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts Gartner More than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date The figure was 30 more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions Gartner said Good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005 said analysts Although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to Gartner that some markets were seeing a slowdown in replacement sales All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the BBC News website Japan is where north America and western European markets can be in a couple of years time They already have TV music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones But there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too according to Gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said Gartner Third generation mobiles 3G with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen At the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who dont really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own The majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms More likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services The Motorola Razr V3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 she added This was not a womens thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of selfexpression too It was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner Western Europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said Ms Milanesi People are after something that is nicelooking and together with that there is the entertainment side This year music will have a part to play in this The market for fulltrack music downloads was worth just 20 million 105 million in 2004 but is set to be worth 18 billion 94 million by 2009 according to Jupiter Research Sony Ericsson just released its Walkman branded mobile phone the W800 which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours battery life and a two megapixel camera In July last year Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones Apple said the new iTunes music player would become Motorolas standard music application for its music phones But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod Ms Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives But they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life

politics,Will the Budget bring out smiling voters,As Tory spokesman Oliver Letwin said any chancellor would use his preelection budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners wouldnt he And everyone does indeed expect Gordon Brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 May There will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways But Mr Brown will stun Westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back Labour in the election And there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this weeks Budget The aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core Labour voters in the fold while ensuring the middle England voters who gave Tony Blair two election victories dont desert him at the third poll And needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the Budget will have on Mr Browns own ambitions to replace Mr Blair as prime minister at some point after a third win But there is a shadow hanging over this preelection performance in the shape of 11 billion or thereabouts That is the size of the financial black hole the Tories backed by some independent forecasters believe Mr Brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election The opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a Treasury leak suggested Mr Brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash It was immediately denied but the Tories remain suspicious claiming that as Mr Letwin said if the money does not come from there where will it come from Mr Brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should Labour win Previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong he will argue while suggesting that only by sticking with him can Britain continue to have a sound economy low unemployment and high public spending The opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same time The Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax And there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in Whitehall and beyond to fund their policies But probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years And it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election
sport,2004 An Irish Athletics Year,2004 wont be remembered as one of Irish athletics great years The year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming Olympiad But come late August a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics or to be more accurate the lack of it Sonia OSullivans Olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers But after the disastrous buildup to the games we shouldnt have been surprised At the start of the year an OSullivan had been earmarked as Irelands best medal prospect but as it turned out walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury Less than a week before the Olympics the sport was rocked by news that 10000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO Lombards shattering of Mark Carrolls national 10000m record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a twoyear ban from the sport Back at preOlympic ranch in Greece it must have seemed that things couldnt have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near Athens Once the track and field action began in Athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Craggs performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5000m final did offer hope for the future Our beloved Sonia scraped into the womens 5K final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shakeup As it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar It later transpired that Sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically the Cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness Amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a worldclass field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over its unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens At the start of the year several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August an outofform and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province The Ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of 2100 and an early exit James McIlroy Gareth Turnbull Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens 800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane The injuryplagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 339 was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKees Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005 Pole vaulter Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after she had achieved the Athens B standard but the call never came As the summer ended stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up their competitive spikes McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injuryravaged years Donnelly and his Annadale Striders teammates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at his home on 18 December A large turnout of athleticsloving folk turned out in west Belfast to offer their respects to the Campbell family and Andys many friends As only death can it put the years athletics happenings in a sharp perspective

politics,Act on detention ruling UK urged,The government must act quickly on the Law Lords ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful Mary Robinson has said The former UN commissioner for human rights and Irish president told Radio 4s Today the governments response would be scrutinised internationally It would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it she said Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present Speaking to Parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following David Blunketts resignation Mr Clarke said I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year In the meantime we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords Mrs Robinson said the Law Lords ruling was in line with international legal opinion and praised their very decisive eight to one majority What the Law Lords did was acknowledge the role of the government but say that there had been a disproportionate use that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didnt apply to British citizens she said Mrs Robinson warned that a lack of action by the British government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg If the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the Law Lords She said a meeting of the Club of Madrid a group of former world leaders to be held in the Spanish capital on the March anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications I have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles but also the response of the British government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Offices powers to hold them without limit or charge The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in antiterrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported The Law Lords said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case

business,Giant waves damage S Asia economy,Governments aid agencies insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern Asia The worsthit areas are Sri Lanka India Indonesia and Thailand with at least 23000 people killed Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about 5bn 26bn similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch Mitch killed about 10000 people and caused damage of about 10bn in 1998 World Bank spokesman Damien Milverton told the Wall Street Journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief Tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east Asian region according to the World Travel and Tourism Council WTTC In the Maldives islands in the Indian ocean twothirds of all jobs depend on tourism But the damage covers fishing farming and businesses too with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves International agencies have pledged their support most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet The International Monetary Fund IMF has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope The IMF stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need said managing director Rodrigo Rato Only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh currently receive IMF support while Indonesia the quakes epicentre has recently graduated from IMF assistance It is up to governments to decide if they want IMF help Other agencies such as the Asian Development Bank have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed There is no underestimating the size of the problem however The United Nations emergency relief coordinator Jan Egeland said that this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas so many vulnerable communities Many people will have had their livelihoods their whole future destroyed in a few seconds He warned that the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water Insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the 27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the US earlier this year The region thats affected is very big so we have to check countrybycountry what the situation is said Serge Troeber deputy head of the natural disasters department at Swiss Re the worlds second biggest reinsurance firm I should assume however that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the US he said Munich Re the worlds biggest reinsurer said This is primarily a human tragedy It is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be Allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability However a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told the Reuters news agency that it was seeking 65m for emergency aid The biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases particularly malaria and diarrhoea the aid agency was quoted as saying The European Union has said it will deliver 3m euros 21m 41m of aid according to the Wall Street Journal The EUs Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Louis Michel was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster Other countries also are reported to have pledged cash while the US State Department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region Getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekends events Many of the worsthit areas such as Sri Lanka Thailands Phuket island and the Maldives are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies December and January are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern Asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 911 slump Growth has been rapid in southeast Asia with the World Tourism Organisation figures showing a 45 increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004 In southern Asia that expansion is 23 India continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country the WTO said Arrivals to other destinations such as Maldives and Sri Lanka also thrived In Thailand tourism accounts for about 6 of the countrys annual gross

business,Iranian MPs threaten mobile deal,Turkeys biggest private mobile firm could bail out of a 3bn 16bn deal to build a network in Iran after MPs there slashed its stake in the project Conservatives in parliament say Turkcells stake in Irancell the new network should be cut from 70 to 49 They have already given themselves a veto over all foreign investment deals following allegations about Turkish firms involvement in Israel Turkcell now says it may give up on the deal altogether Iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network with long waiting lists for new subscribers Turkcell signed a contract for the new network in September The new operator planned to offer subscriptions for about 180 well below the existing firms 500 price tag But a parliamentary commission has now ruled that Turkcells 70 controlling stake is too high They say that Turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with Israel Parliament as a whole dominated by religious conservatives will vote on the ruling on Tuesday Turkcell said the ruling would make more difficult Turkcells financial consolidation of Irancell because its stake would be reduced to less than 50 If management control and financial consolidation of Irancell cannot be achieved the realisation of the project will become risky it warned in a statement The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there The two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004 Israeli industry minister Ehud Olmert was reported in June to have attended a meeting between Ruhi Dogusoy Turkcells chief operating officer and executives from Israeli telecoms firms Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments passed earlier in September The other is airports a source of controversy after the army closed Tehrans new Imam Khomeini International Airport on its opening day in May 2004 Again the allegation was that the partTurkish TAV consortium which built and ran it had links with Israel
politics,Kennedys cautious optimism,Charles Kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election In his 22 years in the Commons he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and he might say the UKs political and electoral system But even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months time Look I have already said I am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around he said He still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another Labour victory of some sort And his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the Lib Dems as the real opposition But doesnt that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second He is prepared to go this far A clear conclusion has been reached including by Conservatives that the Conservatives are not going to win this election Therefore the potential is there for the Liberal Democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election given that we have the capacity to take on Labour and win as well as take on the Conservatives and win This is really going to be the first modern three party UK election that we have all experienced But havent we been here before with suggestions in the 1980s that Labour was finished Wont voters looking for an alternative to Labour still naturally gravitate to the Conservatives The problem is that geographically the Conservative party has melted away in about a third of Britain We have supplanted them as the main alternative to Labour in whole tracts of mainland Britain And they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary Britain Mr Kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned Labour voters He insists his three headline commitments to be financed from a 1 tax increase on those earning over 100000 a year will appeal right across the political spectrum They are to replace the council tax with a local income tax provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees He also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to Old Labour I think the tax argument has moved on a lot in British politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election he said Under a Labour government the tax burden would have to rise while the Tories plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible he claims We are being straightforward with people saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies That is a clear cut choice for people one I am very comfortable with and I think will distinguish us from the others As to his own future he is clear If as expected his party increases its showing at the election he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us That last remark reflects a view gaining ground in Westminster that if the Tories do as badly as some fear the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party Perhaps then Mr Kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side

politics,Retirement age could be scrapped,The myth that ageing is a barrier to contributing to society needs to be exploded the work and pensions minister has said This was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely Alan Johnson said It was also committed to stamping out age discrimination and would outlaw it he told a conference on ageing All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions Mr Johnson told Age Concerns Age Agenda in London the government was seriously considering introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions This idea has been adopted by the Lib Dems as policy while the Tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions Mr Johnsons speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the countrys pension system This would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women he said Speaking at the London conference he said Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were increasingly consigned to the past Were sweeping them away entirely for people under 65 and were giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously And the review in 2011 which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely is to be tied to evidence showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded Mr Johnson said his department had a longterm aspiration of moving towards an 80 employment rate This would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force he said
politics,Blunkett sorry over murder plan,David Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced prematurely via press release a review of murder laws The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as a mess He said the review would look at partial defences to murder including provocation and at mandatory sentences The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year On Wednesday a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday But the announcement never came with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage Amid opposition anger Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his gracious apology and the review itself But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be dragged to face MPs In its report the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be graded to recognise the seriousness of the offence But the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility The commission an independent body including two judges a senior barrister and sentencing experts had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases But it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 among them 21 judges believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was indefensible and should cease A key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence But speaking after the report was published Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence Where an offender is convicted of murder the court must pass a life sentence The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife

business,GSK aims to stop Aids profiteers,One of the worlds largest manufacturers of HIVAids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills supplied to poorer African countries back into Europe for resale at far higher price The company GlaxoSmithKline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way This is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies They want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap antiAids drugs to the worlds poorest nations The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIVpositive Africans through their governments health care systems But the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and reselling them at a higher price GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have resold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade Glaxo says distribution of the newlook drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe
politics,Labour targets hardcore truants,A fresh crackdown on persistent truants in England has been launched by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly Serial truants make up one in 13 pupils Previous initiatives brought 40000 pupils back to school since 1997 according to official statistics Parenting contracts penalty notices and fast track prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem It is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day Tories say Labours previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence where parents are permitted to take children out of school Such absences are often due to family holidays However serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing 885m Those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically Measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their childs attendance improved The tough stance paid off with just 24 issued while attendance improved in 776 cases Truancy has been reduced by 5 at the 128 worst hit schools through the governments Behaviour Improvement Programme This is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since September The new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps the sixth of which will take place on Monday Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school Held twice each year in addition to routine local patrols previous countrywide sweeps have apprehended 31000 pupils dodging school In almost 14000 of those cases the youngsters were accompanied by their parents A Department for Education and Skills source said Every day in school counts It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nations truancy
tech,Software watching while you work,Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrongdoing has been unveiled Worries about cybercrime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees The developers behind the system claim it is a breakthrough in the way data is monitored and stored But privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software The system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists BridgeHead Software They have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes More and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse Sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the National HiTech Crime Unit NHTCU A survey conducted on its behalf by NOP found evidence that more than 80 of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cybercrime BridgeHead Software has come up with techniques to prove to a legal standard that any stored file on a PC has not been tampered with Ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time The storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged Potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party copied printed deleted or saved to CD floppy disk memory stick or flash card Other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use Increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data such as governments are using biometric logins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employees privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff That is not the case said Tim Ellsmore managing director of 3ami It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof he said People need to recognise that you are using a PC as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data he added
tech,Concerns over Windows ATMs,Cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses a security firm has warned The warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the Windows operating system in machines Already there have been four incidents in which Windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the Microsoft operating system But banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small For many years the venerable IBM operating system known as OS2 has been the staple software used to power many of the 14m cash machines in operation around the world But IBM will end support for OS2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives There are also other pressures making banks turn to Windows said Dominic Hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm Retail Banking Research He said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new Europay Mastercard and Visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data US laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways Todd Thiemann spokesman for antivirus firm Trend Micro said the move to Windows in cash machines was not without risks Mr Thiemann said research by the TowerGroup showed that 70 of new cash machines being installed were Windows based Already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them In January 2003 the Slammer worm knocked out 13000 cash machines of the Bank of America and many of those operated by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce In August of the same year cash machines of two unnamed banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the Welchia worm Incidents like this happen said Mr Thiemann because when banks start using Windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers This often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network This could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system he said Banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network Mr Thiemann told BBC News Online But Mr Hirsch from Retail Banking Research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year Currently he said a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10 of all ATMs get swapped for a newer model every year Windows cash machines have been around for several years he said Most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle In theory there is a bigger threat with Windows than OS2 he said but I do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment Its pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with ATMs he said The many different security systems builtin to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said Banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added A spokesman for the Association of Payment and Clearing Services Apacs which represents the UKs payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal Theres no concern that theres going to be any type of virus hitting the UK networks he said Risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect UK cash machines together and the operators of the ATMs themselves were a much smaller and tightlyknit community than in the US where viruses have struck

tech,When invention turns to innovation,It is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past When history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed peoples lives substantially But says Nick Donofrio senior vicepresident of technology and manufacturing at IBM it was not the thing itself that actually improved peoples lives It was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it The car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access When we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st Century we have to think more like this but faster Mr Donofrio told the BBC News website after giving the Royal Academy of Engineering 2004 Hinton Lecture The invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had The equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did These are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years But what it means for technology companies is that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them We are in a different phase now when it comes to technology argues Mr Donofrio Industry Weeks 2003 Technology Leader of the Year The hype and overpromise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life gets better as a result In the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes Somebody had a new thing that would awe you You werent quite sure that it did anything you werent quite sure if you needed it you werent quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool But change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face It will creep in pervasively Nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage I am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure says Mr Donofrio Pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards The net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there like air People will not have to do anything to stay connected People will know their lives are just better says Mr Donofrio Trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know Natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances Ultimately there will be says Mr Donofrio no value in being computer illiterate To some it sounds like a technological world gone mad To Mr Donofrio it is a vision innovation that will happen Behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing says Mr Donofrio Deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing It has value according to IBM because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates But pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts commands and requirements of a diverse world As computing and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture walls and clothing physical space becomes a more important consideration This is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience I am confident that the SET science engineering and technology industry is going to be short on skills he says If I am right about what innovation is you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative Women tend to have those traits a lot better than men Eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he says In the UK a DTIfunded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40 representation on SET industry boards IBM according to Mr Donofrio has 30 Our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career The whole issue of

business,Putin backs state grab for Yukos,Russias president has defended the purchase of Yukos key production unit by stateowned oil firm Rosneft saying it followed free market principles Vladimir Putin said it was quite within the rights of a stateowned company to ensure its interests were met Rosneft bought 100 of Baikal Finance Group in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of Russias booming oil industry Rosneft will now control about 16 of Russias total crude oil output Yukos share jumped in Moscow climbing as much as 50 before being suspended Rosneft is already in the process of merging with Gazprom the worlds biggest gas company a move that will see Gazprom return to majority stateownership Baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant Yukoss main production division at a forced auction on Sunday Everything was done by market methods Mr Putin said at his yearend press conference in Moscow Shedding some light on the Kremlins motivation Mr Putin referred to a period of socalled cowboy capitalism that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union He said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery including law breaking by people seeking to acquire valuable state property Now the state using market methods is safeguarding its interests I think this is quite normal the Russian president said A Rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a balanced national energy corporation The latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos one of Russias biggest companies to the brink of collapse The Russian government put Yukoss Yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a 27bn 14bn bill for back taxes and fines Analysts say that Yukoss legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the US are probably what caused this weeks cloakanddagger dealings Gazprom the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas was banned from taking part in the auction by a US court injunction By selling the Yukos unit to littleknown Baikal and then to Rosneft Russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines analysts said You cannot sue the Russian government said Eric Kraus a strategist at Moscows Sovlink Securities The Russian government has sovereign immunity The government is renationalising Yuganskneftegas Even so analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go The Rosneft announcement came just hours after Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sundays auction It has said it will be seeking damages of 20bn The claim was made at the latest hearing in the US bankruptcy court in Houston Texas where Yukos had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection If found in contempt of the US court order blocking the auction Gazprom could face having foreign assets seized Yukos lawyers had also been expected to try to have Baikals assets frozen Lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because Yukos with an office in Houston had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of US law which has worldwide jurisdiction Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned
business,UK risks breaking golden rule,The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its golden rule a report suggests The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest and not to finance its spending projects The National Institute of Economic and Social Research NIESR claims that taxes need to rise by about 10bn if state finances are to be put in order The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008 According to NIESR if the governments current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is unlikely the golden rule will be met Should the cycle end a year earlier then the chances improve to 5050 Either way fiscal tightening is needed NIESR said The report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections Earlier this month accountancy firm Ernst Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Browns forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic It claimed revenues were likely to be 6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims saying it was on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable Other than its warning on possible tax hikes the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy It said the recent recordbusting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion saying that if anything the world economy will continue to grow strongly Global gross domestic product GDP is tipped to be 41 this year dipping to 4 in 2005 before picking up again to 42 in 2006 The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006 albeit at a slightly slower rate as will be the case in Japan Hinting at better times for UK exporters NIESR said the euro zone is expected to pick up speed Growth in Britain also is set to accelerate it forecast Despite weak growth in the third quarter the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006 NIESR said adding that the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery GDP is expected at 32 in 2004 and 28 in both 2005 and 2006 The main cloud on the horizon NIESR said was the UKs much analysed and fretted over property market

tech,Games deserve a place in class,Computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom say researchers Academics from the Institute of Education at London University found that games literacy was a key skill for youngsters As well as being used in different areas of the curriculum games are a legitimate area of study in their own right researchers say Pupils should also be able to create their own games they say Like all games computer and video games entertain while promoting social development and playing and talking about games is an important part of young peoples lives said project manager Caroline Pelletier Games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation just like writing or drawing she said The researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning Researchers found that girls were often excluded from the maledominated world of game playing Without firsthand experience of how much fun a game can be they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity said research fellow Diane Carr The second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them Sixthform teacher Barney Oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film TV and popular music at the Alevel course he runs at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge For parents the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment could cause controversy Dr Andrew Burn associate director of the Institute of Educations Centre for the Study of Children Youth and Media moved to reassure anxious parents Games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film television and literature do he said But we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games The games industry welcomed the report saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children At a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently said Roger Bennett director general of the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association This report is further evidence if it were needed about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming They have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career The threeyear research project which is being presented at a seminar on Tuesday in London was partly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry

tech,Fileswappers ready new network,Legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down One site behind the success of the BitTorrent fileswapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised That filesharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnovaorg which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to Now the man behind suprnovaorg who goes by the nickname Sloncek is preparing to release software for a new fileswapping network dubbed Exeem In an interview with Novastream web radio Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa filesharing systems Like BitTorrent Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone There will be no centrally maintained list This said Sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users An early public version of the software should be available before February Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program Despite Suprnova administrator Slonceks involvement with Exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files Sloncek told Novastream Dr Johan Pouwelse a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peertopeer networks said Exeem was the next evolution in filesharing systems But he said it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared Exeem cannot prevent pollution he said The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one thats full of crap like Kazaa he said There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of filesharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading When big files were being shared moderation systems were key said Mr Pouwelse He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic Its hard to compete with free he said Noone from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the filesharing development

politics,Falconer rebuts charade claims,Concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia through the back door were not a political ploy the lord chancellor has said Ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the Mental Capacity Bill amid chaotic scenes in the Commons on Tuesday Lord Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear The bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves Ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards Critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment including food and fluids Tony Blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill But changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from Hillsborough coma victim Tony Bland It is important we dont end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen he said On Tuesday the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203 despite rebellion by 34 Labour MPs The revolt was also reduced by news that Lord Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill But that only came after MPs bombarded Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark Eventually he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes prompting claims of a shambles The deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been Lord Falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the House of Lords He told BBC News We have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life The motive has got to be to end suffering He denied the concessions were a political manoeuvre forced by panic about the rebellion It was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through Parliament but the result was a sensible solution he said I dont think it is something to be embarrassed about These issues are not easy to deal with he went on BBC political editor Andrew Marr said Mr Lammy was waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast after his performance But Lord Falconer praised his minister for an excellent job Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith one of the chief critics of the plans condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague
