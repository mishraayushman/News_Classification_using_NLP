Sound 2004 list artists watch published start last year Scissor Sisters Franz Ferdinand Keane Joss Stone McFly Sound 2004 top 10 The five Brits winners already established Sound 2004 compiled The ceremony televised ITV1 Thursday Im speechless Best song last 25 years Yeah right I much doubt Angels even best song week came Like every track Robbie released single blatant poor facsimile something someone else done better Give us break Best song 25 years must joking Its good like sort thing really Listened Angels Radio 1 morning I driving work Had heard I love Robs voice lyrics tune Perfection As usual public short memories comes voting greatest There must dozen songs last 25 years deserve award Its exactly groundbreaking Presumably age range could bothered vote pretty low Im actually embarrassed British best song produced last 25 years What The Specials Ghost Town The Buzzcocks Ever Fallen Love With Someone Happy Mondays Kinky Afro McAlmont Butler Yes Joy Division Love Will Tear Us Apart Angels middleoftheroad rubbish Angels awful piece sentimental claptrap Its musically lyrically inept fantastically overrated bit like Mr Williams This result isnt surprising though The Brits long history celebrating rubbish music Best last 25 years Maybe Cunning make timescale include Stairway Heaven Bohemian Rhapsody kind make bit hollow award really Not much competition last 25 years Its alright pop song best song last 25 years There way earth song voted best last 25 yearsits travesty Rubbish Who voted included list I regular listener Radio 2 I dont recall invitation vote bland slushy rubbish might appeal masses wouldnt know good song jumped bit nose certainly NOT best song last 25 years How depressing thought manufactured pop way earth dreadful list appear While I biassed I thought Love Will Tear Us Apart seriousness I think best song last 25 years include songs less 5 years old would exclude songs popular novelty Then well done Robbie good show Youve got kidding Angels great song best song last 25 years Only best song nomination Brits I think Angels great song deserved run award I dont think best song past 25 years Right enough better others catergory example Will Young nominated first place alright song isnt good Im happy Robbie though Best song last 25 years What Joke Think great rock pop songs released 80s pretty much better Angels Phil Collins doesnt deserve awards good songs wrote Angels overrated song got tiresome even finished listening Soppy rubbish best Hopefully manufactured rubbish die soon let real artists worked hard glory receive awards So boringly obvious typical bland nature mainstream music Britain today proof music democracy dont mix Still least wasnt Will Young Oh bit fun People take awards seriously Robbie millions loyal fans even nonfans know words angels Him winning obviously reflects votes awards Personally I wanted Will Young win really due musical talent I hate song brings back memories school discos noone slowdance I agree Angels I never get fed hearing Whenever song comes radio I turn radio smile sing along badly radio turned drown voice The song makes calm serene happy Well done Robbie I think although Robbie Williams good performer Angels isnt really good song It certainly isnt anywhere near good Love Will Tear Us Apart Joy Division Wuthering Heights Kate Bush Angels fantastic song All credit Robbie Williams Guy Chambers Its song played forever bridges age groups Robbie way deserve mantle Whenever awards always artists past five years seem win best bestWe forget late 80s early 90s example They werent cool time cool shows songs greater longevity people think Yes Angels best song since past 25 years touches soul carries lot meaning Ive always disliked Angels intensely I believe symbolic general capacity British preteens teens middle aged women accept low quality low aspirational music classic songwriting Its orrible It seems obvious people like Robbie people dont particularly like music much Folks without collections folks never engaged madness one experiences falling spell pop music Angels adds nothing merely irritating distraction wasp refuses go away summers afternoon picnic What dreadful result If voted feel ashamed probably know dozen songs dont get applying uninformed filter casting ridiculous vote Booo hisss Angels best song You kidding right Last five years I might willing accept 25 way Did whoever voted actually ANY music knowledge prior say 1995 Really quite insulting British music industry past quarter century No surprise Robbie Williams considering list Where earth nominations list come Compiled eleven yearold girl perhaps I mean Will Young Come What load crap best song last 25 years I dont think What REAL artists last 25 years list endless Robbie Williams doesnt even come close What joke That song become bane I developed Pavlovian response word Angels I thrash around scream someone tells radios Why halfbaked cheesy ditty like Angels become anthem millions romantic sops think many times sung Pop Idol example voted best song past 25 years beyond If song others judged musicians may well give Why reward mediocrity highly country The initial list weak anyway Angels best song last 25 years I think I didnt realize Radio 2 many listeners age 10 People short memories A great song yes best last 25 years Not chance I think person opposed song voted The Great British Public work Its mediocre sentimental safe song Granted bad either But stand ANYTHING The Smiths particular How Soon Now anything Stone Roses first album Nope No Because Im female Im 10 Ok I like Robbie Angels decent song But way best song past 25 years The shortlist wasnt great winning joke Predictable laughable The success Angels years Brits reflects poorly state British music last 25 years The British public brainwashed corporate pulp presneted cutting edge music true talent sadly missed Whilst Angels popular song even best song Robbies repertoire never mind best song last 25 years I huge Robbie fan love song But I think lot outstanding songs music influenced music today unfortunately left list Have Radio 2 listeners even heard Joy Division A band two albums bigger impact music continue last 25 years Robbie Williams ever No doubt Theres song done anyone emotion feeling Some people adopt slightly snobby stances Angels hit home far larger audience song It Joy DivisionThose guys played influential part shaping modern day music Angels remains yet another pop song I sincerely believe 25 years influential artists argue Robbie Williams inspired art way Byrds Beatles Nick Drake done music today Yes I think brilliantly written song different meanings different people There great songs category somebody win Robbie deserved winner I astounded secondrate record beaten line amazing songs terrible song voted masses dont brains appreciate innovative exciting music The best song past 25 years Really Come surely joke No I think I need long lie It goes show british public clue good quality music pick Robbie Williams beautifully talented Kate Bush Joy Division I suppose confirmed one thing British public consistently dull lt No offence Robbie pleeease There must thousand better songs formulated cheesy pop song kids No one agrees quite frankly embarassment integrity British music nail coffin I think Robbie deserves iconic stars Britain since John Lennon idol millions worldwide Anybody says doesnt deserve jealous success The real challenger Queen hey Another One Bites Dust Obviously Karaoke singers UK voted If best song last 25 years British Music industry trouble Sure Robbie talented produces excellent material best record A sad day music Its type music I normally like even diehard rock fan I recognise good song appelas people Thats voted best song last 25 years Its good allrounder Just like Robbie Best song 25 years Since 1980 Im confused Angels isnt bad song Its nice catchy formulaic anthem ticks boxes But great music If anything regressive Bland even I suppose evidence redundant Brit Awards become Granted angels good song however really wasnt proper competition The Queens song lackluster apart Kate Bush choices pathetic Also werent Stones David Bowie etc many greater songs AngelsI wonder simply fact Robbie wasnt getting awards make one Best song last 25 years What ridiculuous concept even ridiculous winner Sigh On upside least wasnt Bohemian Rhapsody thankful Angels without doubt great song I really dont think deserves title best song 25 yearsperhaps vote teenage opinion Robbies goodlooks actual song Dont get wrong Im disputing looks deserved winners It would travesty Angels Without Angels Robbie Williams may well Britain would deprived one charismatic talented performing artists It seen performed live 125000 people singing along fully appreciated Well done Rob I find hard believe Angels best show past 25 years Im rapidly redifining best head mean gratuitously played weddings funerals people think deep meaning What Britpop Blur Oasis Suede Pulp making fantastic songs also making changes something different Why must best always come commercially popular Ive nothing Robbie I actually like music possibly best song last 25year The Brits proved nothing bargaining tool pop moguls boost band profiles record sales The goes Scissor Sisters I think superb record thoroughly deserves newcomer award album comes near U2s new record neither league Once baffling discisions made artisic reasons profit No surprise really voted general public Since taste music Personally I find Angels Robbie Williams one irritating songs I ever heard It absolutely deserved win It song united generations continue played many years come Its absolute joke however original 25 poor choices well All pretty pointless exercise The song overplayed oversentimental Out rather poor five choices left gone either Joy Division Queen I suppose thankful didnt end hands Will Young though Although nostalgia value way deserved win Everybody knows words Bohemian Rhapsody Nothing Compares 2 U etc Much better songs timeless Give someone real talent Although Angels good song I think anyone slightest musical taste realise best song last 25 years This another example record company manipulation keep artist public eye Why give award greatest pair trousers thats means
